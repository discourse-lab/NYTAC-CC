        <p>Barbara Bonney has been bringing her radiant lyric soprano voice and fair-haired beauty to the opera stage for some 20 years. In recent seasons she has been increasingly devoted to the song recital. She is not going to disappear from opera: in December she sang a much-praised Susanna in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' at the Metropolitan.</p>
        <p>Still, lovers of fine vocal artistry should be cheered by Ms. Bonney's increasing involvement with the song literature. Her recital at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night, with the pianist Warren Jones, was exquisite.</p>
        <p>The program of songs by Stenhammar, Sibelius and Grieg was drawn from Ms. Bonney's recent Decca recording, ''Diamonds in the Snow,'' songs by Nordic composers, with the conductor Antonio Pappano at the piano. Here, with the technically elegant and imaginative Mr. Jones as her pianist, Ms. Bonney sang with scrupulous musicianship, exceptional sensitivity and, at least to this non-Nordic listener, convincingly idiomatic delivery of the Swedish, Norwegian and German texts.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the advocacy of Swedish singers like Anne Sofie von Otter and others, the songs of Wilhelm Stenhammar, who died in Stockholm in 1927, are becoming better known. Those Ms. Bonney performed here were enchanting, like the wistful ''Adagio'' with its lapping piano accompaniment and plaintive melody. When a soprano has a voice as sheerly beautiful as Ms. Bonney's, the temptation to show it off in each phrase must be hard to resist. Ms. Bonney resists it. In the impassioned Stenhammar song ''Sverige'' (''Sweden''), she was not reluctant to sing with earthy energy, grainy chest tones and tremulous vibrato when the music called for it. But in places where tender, sustained, focused pianissimos were wanted, she provided them effortlessly.</p>
        <p>Her Sibelius group began with a novelty, ''Vilse'' (''Lost in the Forest''), this Finnish composer's equivalent of a Gilbert and Sullivan patter song. It was a fascinating idea for Ms. Bonney to sing two settings of a Swedish poem by Runeberg, titled (in English translation) ''The Girl Came Home From Meeting Her Lover.'' Whereas Sibelius begins with deceptively Romantic melodiousness before the song turns grim, bleakness shrouds the Stenhammar setting from the first halting chords in the piano.</p>
        <p>A few of the Grieg songs Ms. Bonney sang were famous, including ''Solveig's Song,'' best known from its use in the incidental music for ''Peer Gynt,'' and the perennial encore piece ''Jeg elsker dig'' (''I Love You''). The intelligence, sincerity and vocal culture Ms. Bonney brought to her performances made the music seem utterly fresh. She also sang memorably six seldom-heard Grieg songs on German texts. As a song recitalist, Ms. Bonney is in her artistic prime.</p>
