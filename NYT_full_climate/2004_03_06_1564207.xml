        <p>The heat wave that scorched Europe last summer was part of a three-decade-long warm period on the continent that was ''very likely unprecedented for more than the past 500 years,'' Swiss scientists are reporting in the current issue of the journal Science. Their study also showed that European summers since 1994 were the hottest consecutive string of summers in the same span. The researchers did not speculate on the cause, and other climate experts said the warming was likely to continue.</p>
