        <p>As spacecraft go, it is small, inexpensive and normally would hardly stand out among the dozens of satellites and probes NASA is planning to send into space. But Triana, because of its unusual origin and mission, has attracted a lot of attention. And it is in trouble because of it.</p>
        <p>The goals of this simple satellite, designed to view the Earth from afar, have become complicated by the reality of Washington politics. The debate over whether the mission is a good idea or not is muddled by the awareness of whose idea it was in the first place.</p>
        <p>Triana, in its earliest incarnation, is the brainchild of Vice President Al Gore. In a speech on March 13, 1998, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Gore challenged NASA to build and fly an inexpensive spacecraft that would make continuous, live pictures of the full, sunlit Earth from far out in space that would be available to the world at all times via the Internet and television.</p>
        <p>Weather and scientific satellites view the Earth all the time, but they orbit so close that they only see a portion of the planet at a time. Any ''whole Earth'' view has to be stitched together from several images, and none of these displays can be done in real time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that seeing the entire Earth against the blackness of space at any time, which is not now possible, would inspire environmental consciousness and encourage new educational and scientific efforts. As the nation's classrooms and homes are connected to the Internet and cable television, he said, the images could arouse new feelings among millions of Americans about their home planet.</p>
        <p>As White House aides tell it, Mr. Gore's idea came to him almost in a dream. He awoke at 3 A.M. one day in February 1998, and thought about a global view of Earth, they say, perhaps inspired by the famous ''Blue Marble'' photograph of the planet taken in December 1972 by the returning crew of Apollo 17, the last moon mission. A copy of the picture hangs in Mr. Gore's office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also gave the Earth-watching project its name, after Rodrigo de Triana, the lookout aboard Christopher Columbus's ship who first saw the New World in 1492.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Gore told the NASA administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, about the idea and asked if it was feasible, the agency made a quick study of the proposal and concluded that it could be done for between $20 million and $50 million. But after NASA asked for bids on the project, it grew from a simple camera-in-space idea -- nicknamed by some the Gorecam or Goresat -- to a more elaborate spacecraft that would also do environmental monitoring of the Earth and the Sun. Last October, after an evaluation of nine competing proposals, the agency selected one from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego for a $75 million mission.</p>
        <p>Instead of just a video camera for taking pictures of the Earth, the Scripps mission includes a multi-spectral imager that sees a variety of wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet to near infrared, to measure ozone, cloud height, the amounts of aerosols and particulates suspended in the air and other parameters. It also includes a radiometer for monitoring the solar radiation reflected back into space by Earth and an instrument package for monitoring solar events that could affect electrical equipment on Earth.</p>
        <p>''By no means is this the 'Gorecam,' '' said Dr. Francisco P.J. Valero, director of the Atmospheric Research Laboratory at Scripps and principal investigator for Triana. ''We wouldn't get into this unless there is good, substantial science. We will be looking at the planet in a way it has never been looked at before.''</p>
        <p>But as interest in Triana grew, so did opposition from some space scientists concerned about diminishing NASA budgets and politicians on Capitol Hill, particularly Republicans. NASA found $35 million in its fiscal 1999 budget to begin the project, but ran into renewed opposition this spring in trying to get $32 million for Triana for the 2000 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>On May 13, the Republican-controlled House Science Committee voted 21 to 18 along party lines to send a $41.2 billion, three-year NASA authorization bill to the full House without Triana financing. The measure included an amendment by Representative Dave Weldon, Republican of Florida, who called Triana ''a multimillion-dollar screen saver'' and ''tripe science,'' that shifted money for the project to other research.</p>
        <p>Speaking against Mr. Weldon's amendment, Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, accused Republicans of attacking Triana in a partisan effort to hurt Mr. Gore's Presidential aspirations while ignoring the scientific and educational uses of the program.</p>
        <p>On May 19, when the House considered the NASA financing bill, Republicans attacked the project, with the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, calling it a ''far-out boondoggle'' and Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin branding it ''the Vice President's late-night inspiration.'' The House voted 259 to 168 to pass the measure without Triana financing.</p>
        <p>Democratic leaders said they would ask their Senate colleagues to reinsert money for Triana this summer when conference committees of both houses meet to reconcile their spending bills. In addition, White House and NASA aides said Mr. Goldin might recommend a Presidential veto of a final agency spending bill that did not include Triana.</p>
        <p>If Triana survives the budget wars, there is still discussion among scientists on what the spacecraft will do and how valuable a scientific contribution it can make.</p>
        <p>The spacecraft is scheduled for launching from a space shuttle during a flight in December 2000. After a six-month journey, it is to enter an orbit about a million miles from Earth at a point called Lagrange 1. At this point, the gravitational pulls of the Sun and the Earth balance one another, leaving a spacecraft to match the Earth's track around the Sun. There are several spacecraft already at Lagrange 1, but they all face the Sun.</p>
        <p>Triana would always have the Sun at its back and its face toward the sunlit side of Earth turning beneath it. There it would constantly image the planet. Several times a year, Triana would take detailed pictures of the far side of the Moon, fully lighted by the Sun, as it passed between Triana's camera and Earth.</p>
        <p>Dr. Valero, the project's principal scientist, said Triana would be the first craft to study Earth's energy balance and how it affects climate. The planet absorbs energy from the Sun that drives its weather and climate, but it also reflects an unknown amount of energy into space. The instruments would also track clouds and the types of particles in them to see how they affect energy exchanges in the atmosphere and how much potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation reaches Earth's surface.</p>
        <p>''We have thought about doing science like this for years, and now it's possible,'' Dr. Valero said. ''A lot of thought has gone into these experiments. Science like this does not come out of a dream.''</p>
        <p>But there is disagreement about the project's worthiness.</p>
        <p>''If you went to the scientific community and asked what is needed most for Earth science, this would not be it,'' said Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''I don't see a big benefit to science coming out of this. This is a strange way to go about designing a project, starting with the Vice President having a dream.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindzen said that if NASA wanted to devote part of its resources to public relations, the agency might be justified in doing so. But he said it should not call these projects ''science'' or devote too much of its limited funds to them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Steven C. Wofsy, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Harvard University, says he was initially very skeptical about the Triana proposal, but now says believes it may produce useful science. He is not involved with the project, but serves on a scientific committee that was briefed on it.</p>
        <p>''I was impressed by how carefully thought out the experiments were,'' Dr. Wofsy said. ''These people were determined to make something out of it and they did. It's more than a world-cam, which no one needs, and offers potentially unique results.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Donald Johnson, a retired professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Wisconsin who is now with the Universities Space Research Association, says he can understand why some people oppose Triana because of its political origins or its use of money that could go to other projects.</p>
        <p>''It comes with some political baggage,'' he said, ''but it still can be useful.''</p>
        <p>Aside from any scientific payoff, he said, continued monitoring of Earth can attract attention to the planet's problems globally and be a useful educational tool.</p>
        <p>''There is some value in just making people aware of their world,'' Dr. Johnson said.</p>
