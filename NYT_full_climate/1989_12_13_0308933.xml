        <p>Another season is missing. The evidence is in this graph, which charts New York City's recent weather. October shows peak after peak of summer days. Winter isn't even supposed to start till next week, yet November plunged us prematurely into midwinter. Fall has been squeezed out.</p>
        <p>Occasionally spring is missing, but it at least is supposed to be fickle. Fall is supposed to be the steadfast season, mature, mellow. There's nothing steadfast about the peaks and plunges on the chart. That first crest is the day you picked violets at the roadside. The third crest over is the afternoon you had to put suntan lotion on while raking up the leaves. Thanksgiving Day brought that big drop; one really could have gone to grandmother's house, as the song tells it, over white and drifted snow.</p>
        <p>There have been other lost seasons in the history of America's climate. In 1816, ''the year without a summer,'' there were 20-inch snowdrifts in June in New England, and an August freeze killed the corn crop. That weather was caused by the eruption of Mount Tamora in the South Pacific, which spread clouds of volcanic ash around the globe.</p>
        <p>For centuries we have depended more on poets than on meteorologists to chart the procession of the seasons. What will happen now? What use will it be to ask the wind about winter's coming if spring never shows up? Or will spring reverse things and sit in winter's lap? Now, instead of poets, we have to look to graphs.</p>
