        <p>Gasoline prices skidded yesterday on concerns about a drop in demand because  of the blizzard this week in the Northeast, which brought East Coast traffic to  a standstill.</p>
        <p>The February contract lost 1.83 cents and settled near the day's low on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The exchange was closed on Monday because of the storm, so its full impact on prices hit yesterday.</p>
        <p>Any time you have the Governor of New Jersey forbidding people from driving, you're going to put a dent in demand," said Tim Evans, an analyst with  the Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had declared a state emergency and travel ban because of the storm.</p>
        <p>The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York remained closed yesterday. On other markets, wheat and soybean futures surged in response to rumors of new  exports.</p>
        <p>The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.36 point from  Monday, at 246.28.</p>
        <p>Gasoline futures were also hurt by the latest industry data showing a rise of 5.1 million barrels last week in the nation's gasoline stocks.</p>
        <p>Despite the storm and frigid temperatures, heating-oil futures closed lower,  erasing sharp gains earlier in the session. Traders said the market was disappointed that crude oil failed to rise. Also, weather forecasts call for a warming trend over much of the nation later this week.</p>
        <p>Crude for February delivery lost 31 cents and settled at $19.95 a barrel; February heating oil was 0.21 cent lower at 60.43 cents a gallon; February gasoline was 1.83 cents lower at 58.65 cents a gallon, and February natural gas  was 1.2 cents higher at $2.928 for 1,000 cubic feet.</p>
        <p>On the Chicago Board of Trade, optimism over exports propelled wheat and soybeans to substantial gains. The market was dominated by rumors that China was buying soybeans and possibly wheat, and that Russia was in the wheat market.</p>
        <p>Wheat for March delivery gained 12 1/4 cents, settling at $4.95 3/4 a bushel, and January soybeans were 8 3/4 cents higher at $7.36 1/4 a bushel.</p>
