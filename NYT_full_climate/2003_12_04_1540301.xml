        <p>Editorial says human life would probably not have evolved if meteor strike 65 million years ago had not wiped out dinosaurs and if far greater meteor strike 251 million years ago had not caused as much of 90 percent of life on earth to disappear; says that even knowing this, we are still bound by ethical and practical reasons to see that species that share planet with us are not destroyed because of how we life (National Edition)</p>

        <p>One of the great advantages of being short-lived by geological standards is that life seems relatively stable to us. In the span of time that we humans have been fully ourselves as a species -- the oldest human fossils are only 160,000 years old -- life on this planet has gone on essentially uninterrupted, no matter how cataclysmic our own history has been. We live in the midst of one of the great extinctions, largely caused by humans, and yet we've experienced nothing like the meteor that crashed into the earth 65 million years ago and destroyed the dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>That extinction is dwarfed by the one that took place 251 million years ago, an event some scientists call the ''great dying.'' As much as 90 percent of the life on earth may have disappeared. Scientists studying new evidence, including meteorite fragments from Antarctica, now argue that the extinction then -- the greatest of them all -- was probably caused by a meteor impact as well.</p>

        <p>One of the great advantages of being short-lived by geological standards is that life seems relatively stable to us. In the span of time that we humans have been fully ourselves as a species -- the oldest human fossils are only 160,000 years old -- life on this planet has gone on essentially uninterrupted, no matter how cataclysmic our own history has been. We live in the midst of one of the great extinctions, largely caused by humans, and yet we've experienced nothing like the meteor that crashed into the earth 65 million years ago and destroyed the dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>That extinction is dwarfed by the one that took place 251 million years ago, an event some scientists call the ''great dying.'' As much as 90 percent of the life on earth may have disappeared. Scientists studying new evidence, including meteorite fragments from Antarctica, now argue that the extinction then -- the greatest of them all -- was probably caused by a meteor impact as well.</p>
        <p>The explosion would have been colossal enough, but it also sparked increased volcanism around the globe, compounding the dire climatic changes that were caused by the airborne debris from the collision itself.</p>
        <p>Every day many meteors, most of them tiny, reach the earth's atmosphere. It's a condition of the astronomical neighborhood we live in. But it is hard to take in the fact that catastrophic meteor impacts have played such an enormous part in the history of life on this planet.</p>
        <p>Many people have wondered what life on earth would have looked like -- and whether humans would have evolved -- if the dinosaurs had not died out. That one collision 65 million years ago represented a critical branching in the possibilities of life. But what would life look like if the ''great dying'' had never taken place 251 million years ago? Even the dinosaurs look conjectural then.</p>
        <p>All of this is a bold reminder of how contingent our human presence on earth really is. It took at least two major meteoric collisions to set us on our current path. It is also a reminder of the essential vitality of life itself, which can weather such rugged shocks to the system.</p>
        <p>The knowledge of that vitality is immensely encouraging. But it must never serve as a way of excusing our own responsibility as we watch species after species die out during our tenacious occupation of the globe.</p>
        <p>There's no controlling the possibility of a meteor strike. But there's every reason -- ethical and practical -- for preventing our own habitation of earth from having the same impact.</p>
