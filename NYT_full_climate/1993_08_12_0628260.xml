        <p>The $1.6 billion sale to private investors of a huge thermoelectric power plant in northern Mexico has been thrown into doubt by concerns that pollution from the plant could blow over the border into Big Bend National Park in Texas.</p>

        <p>The $1.6 billion sale to private investors of a huge thermoelectric power plant in northern Mexico has been thrown into doubt by concerns that pollution from the plant could blow over the border into Big Bend National Park in Texas.</p>
        <p>The future of the nearly completed plant, which the Mexican Government had hailed as a first, shining example of its new effort to privatize the generation of badly needed electricity, is now mired in complex political bargaining tied to the North American Free Trade Agreement, officials said.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Mexican Government and Mission Energy Company, the American concern that negotiated to buy the 1,400-megawatt plant along with a Mexican mining company, insist there is no conclusive evidence that its emissions would degrade air quality in Big Bend National Park, 130 miles northwest, as the United States Environmental Protection Agency fears.</p>
        <p>But both sides say concerns about pollution across the border have been enough to generate a wave of American pressure for the plant to be refitted to meet not only the emissions standards of Mexico and the World Bank, which was to help finance the project, but something approaching the higher standards of the E.P.A. as well.</p>
        <p>Equipment to reduce the emissions to levels that would be permissible in the United States could cost the coal-fired plant as much as $300 million, Mission executives say. And that is much more than Mission and its majority partner, Grupo Acerero del Norte, say they will spend before renegotiating the 30-year contract under which they are to sell most of their electricity to Mexico's state-owned utility.</p>
        <p>"We're kind of between a rock and a hard place," said Bob Dietch, a senior vice president of Mission Energy, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison. "Whatever the two Governments resolve, we will try to work with them." But, referring to the trade agreement, he added, "We've gotten caught up in the Nafta debate."</p>
        <p>The struggle over the plant, known as Carbon II, underscores both how sharply the pressure to "harmonize" Mexican environmental standards with those of the United States has risen during the American debate over the trade agreement and the complications of doing so.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration is expected to submit the agreement to Congress this fall so that it can be put into effect as planned next Jan. 1, and concerns about its environmental impact are a major obstacle to its passage. The agreement, which has already been approved in Canada and faces only a perfunctory legislative review in Mexico, would knock down most barriers to trade and investment among the three countries over 15 years. Focus on Enforcing Laws</p>
        <p>In negotiations for a parallel accord to safeguard the environment under the trade pact, American officials have focused mainly on how to insure the enforcement of existing Mexican environmental laws.</p>
        <p>But American and Canadian officials have generally accepted Mexico's claim that it cannot simply raise its environmental standards to their levels. Until Mexico's economy and enforcement mechanisms are strengthened, Mexican officials say, higher standards would probably be unenforceable, not to mention unfair.</p>
        <p>Yet to some American environmentalists and Congressional representatives, Carbon II is a vivid example of the conflicts between Mexico's development and America's environment that have no clear solution. E.P.A. officials stress that they have no regulatory authority over the plant.</p>
        <p>One senior E.P.A. official said that whatever solution the United States recommends it will likely be based not only on the emissions of Carbon II, but also those of Carbon I, a 1,200-megawatt generating plant that the Mexican Government owns and runs nearby.</p>
        <p>The official said the E.P.A. will not necessarily seek to have the plants meet American standards, but to reduce emissions to levels that would safeguard air quality in the United States.</p>
