        <p>LEAD: Looking a little like a high-rise construction project, three tall trees stand surrounded by scaffolding here in an experiment to gauge damage to them from the pollutant ozone.</p>
        <p>Looking a little like a high-rise construction project, three tall trees stand surrounded by scaffolding here in an experiment to gauge damage to them from the pollutant ozone.</p>
        <p>Smog from the San Joaquin Valley in central California is increasingly wafting into the air around the sequoias of the southern Sierra Nevada.</p>
        <p>Earlier research has shown that ozone, the principal component in smog, damages trees a year to 2 years old. The current project is designed to find ozone's effects on mature trees. Damaging ozone results when nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons in smog react in sunlight.</p>
        <p>''The problem we have here in the park is mainly ozone,'' Ranger Diane M. Ewell, an air quality specialist, said Friday. ''We don't have the air problems cities do, such as carbon monoxide. You need great concentrations of carbon monoxide to exceed health standards.''</p>
        <p>The current research began in June about a mile north of Giant Forest Village and 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles when researchers rigged 106-foot-high scaffolding beside three 200-year-old, 165-foot-tall trees.</p>
        <p>Trees Exposed to Ozone</p>
        <p>Four cellophane cylinders about 2 1/2 feet in diameter and 4 feet long were placed over separate boughs on each tree. Ducts bring in air mixed with specific levels of ozone.</p>
        <p>One set of chambers contains half the level of ozone considered normal. The second has normal levels, the third double that amount and the fourth triple. Expected Federal budget cuts make the project's future uncertain.  The project is financed by about $82,000 from the National Park Service and about half that amount from the Forest Service, said Nancy E. Grulke, from the Forest Service's Forest Fire Laboratory in Riverside.</p>
        <p>This summer's statistics will be analyzed by the end of the year, she said.</p>
