        <p>NASA engineers worked today to keep unusually cold Florida weather from delaying the launching of the space shuttle Endeavour early Thursday.</p>
        <p>To keep the shuttle warm, ground workers blew warm air inside and pumped warm nitrogen over the devices that steer the shuttle's boosters, said John Stealey said, a test director at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>In addition, an automatic system of warming bands was wrapped around the O-rings that seal the joints of the solid-rocket boosters. Damaged O-rings, which need to stay pliable, contributed to the deadly explosion of the shuttle Challenger 10 years ago this month.</p>
        <p>The warming devices were developed after the Challenger disaster, a NASA spokesman, George Diller, said.</p>
        <p>"There's nothing exotic about these systems," Mr. Diller said. "But various parts of the shuttle perform best within a certain range, and these systems are  designed to keep the temperatures just right."</p>
        <p>The space agency said there was a 70 percent chance that Endeavour would blast off at 4:18 A.M. Thursday as planned. The biggest threat was clouds moving in from the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The six-member crew, which included a Japanese astronaut, is set for a nine-day flight. Their primary mission is to snare a four-ton Japanese satellite. Later, they are to drop a $10-million NASA satellite into orbit and reel it back two days later after gathering data for four experiments.</p>
