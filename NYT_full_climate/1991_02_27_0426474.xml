        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"The Sky Above, the Slick Below" (Op-Ed, Feb. 9) describes a system of transferable permits to regulate worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. The plan, in a different form, is equally applicable to the problem of the United States trade deficit.</p>
        <p>I believe that our chronic trade balances are the product of:</p>
        <p>(1) A shrinking gap between world productivity and United States productivity that has made our high-wage production uncompetitive. The effect of this, welcomed apparently by the conservative-dominated administrations of the last decade, has been to reduce United States real wages by forcing our workers to compete in low-wage world markets.</p>
        <p>(2) Trade practices by the Japanese that shelter the Japanese domestic market from internal and external competition to provide a secure break-even for Japanese companies. Most of these practices would be antitrust violations if practiced subject to our laws.</p>
        <p>(3) Federal budget deficits that have financed the import boom and alleviated the need for foreign producers to take credit risks to finance their output to us.</p>
        <p>The argument made by supply siders for permitting our chronic trade deficits is that any effort to restrain imports or force bilateral trade balances would inhibit competition and suppress productive forces worldwide. These arguments fail to recognize that the social costs inflicted on United States workers and our economy are not reflected in the price of the foreign goods we buy.</p>
        <p>If we apply the example of carbon emission permits to international trade, the analogous system would take the form of a statutory declaration that a country will not, except as a conscious national policy, import more than it exports. The declaration would be enforced by issuing to all buyers of United States exports a dollar-denominated permit that would constitute a transferable license to export to the United States a like dollar amount of foreign goods and services. Countries such as Japan that maintain a highly favorable trade balance would have to buy more of our goods or purchase permits on the open market, thus increasing the price of their goods, reducing the net price of our goods in world markets and providing hard currency benefits to poorer countries that import from us.</p>
        <p>The permits could be maintained in United States banks that could be drawn on by check or wire transfer to pay the import license over to the Government. Essentially this type of trade quota system has been functioning effectively for years to regulate apparel imports. The difference is that the quota is not based on imports from us.</p>
        <p>The net effect of the permit system would be to establish the price that balances our excess demand for foreign goods, eliminating from our economy the social costs of chronic trade deficits. All this could be accomplished without having to concern ourselves one by one with particular offensive trade practices, without having to establish bilateral trade balances and without having to protect any industries specifically. The Administration has called for market-based approaches. How about this one? DAVID GRUBER Managing Dir., Merchant Banking Carl Marks &amp; Company New York, Feb. 11, 1991</p>
