        <p>Here in the nation's capital, more than four million people are bracing for a possible Supreme Court decision Friday to banish from the roads thousands of diesel buses they ride daily -- buses that belch foul exhaust into the blighted air.</p>
        <p>More than two years ago, the court -- India's main catalyst of environmental reform -- ordered authorities to replace Delhi's entire diesel fleet with 10,000 buses that run on cleaner compressed natural gas. A rococo bureaucracy and a lackadaisical political establishment simply have not done it. The deadline is Sunday.</p>
        <p>Like other sprawling megalopolises in the developing world, Delhi, a state of 13.7 million people that includes the capital, is grappling with how to clean up its unhealthy atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The problem is acute not only here, but in rapidly growing cities across the country. The World Health Organization estimates that as many as 100,000 Indians die each year because of air pollution.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, Delhi has made strides in reducing auto emissions through a switch to unleaded gasoline, among other steps, and there are modest signs that Delhi's air is somewhat cleaner. But Delhi still has among the highest levels of particulate pollution in the world, the worst kind for public health.</p>
        <p>With the deadline looming for buses to change to compressed natural gas and an eleventh hour court hearing scheduled for Friday, panicked bus owners today engaged in that Gandhian staple of protest: a hunger strike unto death.</p>
        <p>The stolid, resolutely well-fed owners of small bus fleets clustered under a tent near the Supreme Court. ''Let Existing Vehicles Complete Their Life,'' said one plaintive banner dangling behind them.</p>
        <p>The bus owners also gathered Wednesday at a Sikh gurudwara, or place of worship, to beseech a higher power for aid. Their prayer was for help in preserving their businesses -- and for the right to continue operating their buses on diesel.</p>
        <p>''When we had no other option, we knocked on the door of God,'' said Harish Sabharwal, whose family owns 24 buses.</p>
        <p>They were joined at the gurudwara by several politicians, including Delhi's chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, who might have been better off praying for their own political survival. Already, people here blame them for the failure to fulfill the court's July 1998 order. And public ire will grow if millions of bus riders cannot get to work and school next week.</p>
        <p>''You want to pass the buck,'' Chief Justice A. S. Anand said sternly at a hearing last week, scolding officials. ''We are not going to run the government for you. You better discharge your duties.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists here had hoped Delhi's transition to compressed natural gas, or CNG, would serve as a model for the world's most polluted cities, but instead it has turned into a cautionary tale of how bureaucratic mulishness and political resistance to change can foil the highest court in the land, at least for a time.</p>
        <p>For almost two years after the Supreme Court mandated the complete phaseout of diesel buses, Delhi continued licensing new diesel buses. They cost half as much as buses that run on compressed natural gas, so private operators kept buying diesel ones and Delhi let them do it.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the central government's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas failed to ensure delivery of sufficient compressed natural gas to meet surging demand, not only from buses, but from motorized rickshaws and taxis, which the court had also ordered to switch to cleaner fuels.</p>
        <p>''The government here is probably the most incompetent in the world on environmental issues,'' said Anil Agarwal, an environmentalist who serves on an authority set up to advise the Supreme Court. ''We make recommendations, but who will follow them?''</p>
        <p>For months, the shortage of compressed natural gas led to an explosion of snaking lines of bus and rickshaw drivers waiting 8, 10, even 12 hours to fill their tanks.</p>
        <p>One recent afternoon, 206 rickshaws waited in a single line that stretched for half a mile. Some drivers snoozed. Some stared blankly. Many fumed about the hardships they have endured.</p>
        <p>Because of long hours waiting for gas every day, Lal Bahadur, who rents a rickshaw for about $3 a day, ceased to earn enough to support his wife and daughter living in a faraway village.</p>
        <p>Mukesh Kumar, who was married at 11 in the tradition of his low caste family, said he had been unable to send to his village for his wife to come live with him here and consummate their marriage because he was so broke.</p>
        <p>''The Supreme Court told the government to do it and they didn't do it,'' said another disgusted rickshaw driver, Muhammad Salahuddin. ''If you keep producing children and don't provide bread, this is what happens.''</p>
        <p>In recent days, lines have eased as stations developed a coupon system for rationing gas and the government forbade the sale of compressed natural gas to privately owned cars, but the shortage remains.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court and the national and Delhi governments are now playing the legal equivalent of a game of chicken. The central and Delhi governments are begging for more time and permission to allow use of diesel.</p>
        <p>Whatever the judges decide, the case will undoubtedly live on long after the next crop of CNG buses are obsolete.</p>
        <p>M. C. Mehta, the small-time lawyer who filed the public interest lawsuit 16 years ago on Delhi's air pollution, sat recently in his cramped, ratty office, marveling at the extraordinary resistance of those in power to do what the court plainly told them they must.</p>
        <p>''I never thought I would have to suffer for so many years,'' he said. "It is unending.''</p>
