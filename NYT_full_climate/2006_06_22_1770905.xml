        <p>Trying to become a leader on two issues that have bedeviled it for decades, Wal-Mart Stores is developing an extensive program to teach its 1.3 million employees in the United States how to take better care of themselves and the environment, people briefed on the plans said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The program, still in the planning stages, is an effort to turn Wal-Mart's work force -- the nation's largest -- into a model for its customers on issues like energy consumption and nutrition, these people said.</p>
        <p>It is also a strategic shift for Wal-Mart. Until now, the company has focused its environmental efforts on creating eco-friendly products and stores and its health care initiatives on devising more generous insurance plans.</p>
        <p>The plan, tentatively called the Environmental Health and Wellness Program, will emphasize practical advice, like replacing traditional 60-watt light bulbs with energy-efficient bulbs that use 13 watts; Wal-Mart stores already carry those bulbs. Another suggestion under consideration is to eat more fish for the health benefits.</p>
        <p>Those who spoke about the plan did so on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart declined to discuss details of the program. But in a statement, the vice president for corporate strategy and sustainability, Andrew Ruben, said, ''We're listening to our associates and getting feedback on what they need in terms of incorporating environment and health and wellness into their lives.''</p>
        <p>For Wal-Mart, the program could help reduce health care spending on a work force that has higher rates of heart disease and diabetes than the general public. It could also improve the company's standing among the image-conscious consumers that it is courting with higher-priced merchandise.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart hopes to provide the lessons in all of its nearly 4,000 domestic stores over the next several years, said the people who spoke about the plans.</p>
        <p>''As we learn more,'' Mr. Ruben said, ''we look forward to developing additional programs to support them.''</p>
        <p>The program, which has not been publicly disclosed, will be overseen by Linda M. Dillman, vice president for risk management and benefits administration, those briefed on it said.</p>
        <p>To help develop the environmental part of the program, Wal-Mart has asked a former president of the Sierra Club, Adam Werbach, to be a consultant. Those negotiations are continuing, several of the people briefed said.</p>
        <p>Reached by phone yesterday, Mr. Werbach declined to comment.</p>
        <p>If he agreed to help Wal-Mart, Mr. Werbach would join an expanding list of environmental advocates who have advised the company on how to improve its record on issues like greenhouse-gas emissions and fuel efficiency.</p>
        <p>The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Institute are both working with the company. But Mr. Werbach's choice is unusual because he has publicly chastised the company. In ''Act Now, Apologize Later,'' Mr. Werbach's 1997 book about activism, he compared Wal-Mart's growth to a ''virus, infecting and destroying American culture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Werbach now runs a San Francisco firm called Act Now Productions, which consults with companies and nonprofit groups on how to use video, the Internet and music in their marketing. On its Web site, the company lists the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation as clients.</p>
        <p>In the past, Wal-Mart has come under sharp criticism for its health insurance and environmental practices. State governments alone have fined Wal-Mart dozens of times for violating rules on storm-water runoff and air pollution.</p>
        <p>But in the last year, the company has introduced significant changes in both health care and environmental policies. Those include sweeping commitments to reduce energy use in its stores, improve its trucks' fuel efficiency and minimize its use of packaging.</p>
        <p>Nu Wexler, communications director for Wal-Mart Watch, a group critical of the retailer, said that Mr. Werbach ''brings a huge amount of responsibility, and his reputation within the environmental movement will be on the line.''</p>
        <p>''Wal-Mart,'' he continued, ''has the resources to hire every environmental activist who has ever criticized its business practices but we hope they will pursue substantive changes versus cosmetic improvements.''</p>
