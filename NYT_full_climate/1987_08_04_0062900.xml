        <p>LEAD: Mayor Koch said yesterday that he supported charging $10-a-day fees on vehicles entering Manhattan south of 59th Street and imposing tolls on four East River bridges as ways of reducing air pollution in New York City.</p>
        <p>Mayor Koch said yesterday that he supported charging $10-a-day fees on vehicles entering Manhattan south of 59th Street and imposing tolls on four East River bridges as ways of reducing air pollution in New York City.</p>
        <p>Unless the number of vehicles moving through Manhattan is reduced, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, Harvey W. Schultz, said, ''it will be almost impossible to achieve compliance with carbon monoxide and ozone standards.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the ozone problem in New York City is getting worse, according to Eric A. Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He said there had been as many days this year with ozone readings above the Federal standard as there were in all of 1986.</p>
        <p>The Mayor said fees or tolls or a combination ''will have to be done in less than two years.'' But he was quick to say that he could not impose the measures unilaterally and that he did not expect the State Legislature to do so unless there were a Federal mandate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch, Mr. Schultz and Mr. Goldstein were among the witnesses at a hearing on the Federal Clean Air Act held at the World Trade Center by the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment.</p>
        <p>Unless the law is revised, New York will be in violation after Dec. 31 for having failed to meet national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. That failure could lead to a Federal ban on new construction projects that create even more pollutants.</p>
        <p>City officials conceded earlier this year that they would be unable to meet the deadline. Among other things, the House panel is considering pushing the deadline ahead by 10 years for such ''severe nonattainment areas'' as New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Although he is opposed to the construction ban, Mayor Koch said: ''I'll tell you the sanction you can impose - 'By X date, the mobile traffic in a particular district will be reduced by X percent.' I would love that.</p>
        <p>''Then I'd say to people in the city, 'The Federal Government says you must do this or we'll withdraw transportation dollars from you.' ''</p>
        <p>Because such fees and tolls are far from reality, city officials have few details about how the system would work. It would probably cost $10 a day - or $300 a month - to drive into Manhattan south of 59th Street.</p>
        <p>These fees might be collected at bridges and tunnels. Motorists within Manhattan might be issued placards to place in their car windows after paying the fee. City officials said they did not envision toll booths where every north-south avenue crosses 59th Street.</p>
        <p>If bridge tolls were imposed, they would be for the Queensboro, Williamsburg, Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges, which do not now have tolls. 'Leverage' for Mayor</p>
        <p>Representative Henry A. Waxman, the Los Angeles Democrat who is the subcommittee chairman, said he would try to give Mayor Koch the ''leverage'' he asked for. But Mr. Waxman would not say specifically that he would propose legislation to curb traffic in central business districts.</p>
        <p>The House panel also took testimony from the Coalition for Improved Transportation and Air Quality, which denounced the fees and tolls as ''radical, draconian restrictions.'' The coalition is composed of executives and labor leaders in the theater, hotel, tourism, retail, real-estate, food and restaurant industries.</p>
        <p>''These restrictions will only exacerbate our current pollution problems and will devastate the region's economy,'' said Scott W. Steffey, executive director of the coalition. 'Particularly Troublesome'</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the ozone problem in New York City ''is particularly troublesome'' and ''is, if anything, worse'' this year than last year.</p>
        <p>He cited figures compiled - and later confirmed - by the State Environmental Conservation Department. At seven ozone monitoring stations in the New York metropolitan area, there were violations of the Federal ozone standard on 16 days in 1986. There have already been 16 days with violations this year.</p>
        <p>By counting each day that each monitoring site has had excessive ozone readings, there have been 32 violations so far this year, compared with 22 in all of 1986.</p>
