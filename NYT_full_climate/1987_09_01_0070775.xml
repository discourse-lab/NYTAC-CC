        <p>EXHAUST from the smokestacks of oceangoing ships has been added to the list of surprisingly potent human contributions to the earth's climate.</p>
        <p>The exhaust produces tiny particles, aerosols, that tend to absorb incoming sunlight and turn it to heat. But scientists studying satellite images have found a far more important effect: the same particles serve as seeds for the formation of cloud particles.</p>
        <p>As a result, where ships have passed by, clouds tend to be made up of more and smaller particles. That lets them reflect more sunlight than similar but unpolluted clouds, making them brighter from space, especially at wavelengths near the infrared.</p>
        <p>The researchers believe that the cooling effect of the pollution substantially outweighs the warming effect of absorption by the particles themselves. The findings were reported in Science by experts from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.</p>
