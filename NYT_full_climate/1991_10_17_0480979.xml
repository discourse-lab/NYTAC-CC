        <p>New York City's streets, already festooned with signs that tell the time, the temperature and the national debt, will soon have signs that provide air pollution readings, Mayor David N. Dinkins said today at a meeting here of leaders of the world's major cities.</p>
        <p>He said the plan is to install monitors at pollution "hot spots" throughout the city to increase public awareness of the problem.</p>
        <p>"I'm fascinated by the notion," Mr. Dinkins said in an interview. "It's like the wheel: You wonder why we didn't think about it sooner."</p>
        <p>He said the program, similar to one in Sao Paulo, Brazil, would begin on April 22, Earth Day, and might eventually be used as the basis for adjusting traffic flow in the city.</p>
        <p>The Mayor said he could foresee a time when, "as a matter of routine," newscasters and newspapers would use readings on the pollution meters to report pollution levels. The meters would measure carbon monoxide, ground-level ozone and soot in the air.</p>
        <p>The monitors are expected to cost about $30,000 each, and the Mayor said he thought corporate sponsors would pick up the entire cost. Corporations would be offered space on the monitors for institutional advertising.</p>
        <p>A task force of 12 city agencies agreed at a meeting on Oct. 10 to develop a plan to get the program in operation by April, Mr. Dinkins said. The planners still have to decide on the design of the monitors and their locations. Most of the areas with the poorest air quality are in Brooklyn and Manhattan, officials said.</p>
        <p>The plan is being pressed now to help generate public support for meeting 1994 standards of air quality mandated by the Federal Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Mayor Dinkins said the city was beginning to experiment with other pollution-control ideas, like using buses powered by natural gas and converting the city's fleet of cars to run on natural gas.</p>
        <p>At the meeting of mayors, titled the "Third Summit of the World's Major Cities," Mr. Dinkins also announced that Con Edison and Brooklyn Union Gas would provide the city with nearly $2 million to convert 350 city vehicles to operate on compressed natural gas. They would be in addition to 110 city vehicles already using this kind of fuel.</p>
        <p>Public-interest environmental groups responded positively to the Mayor's plan. Eric A. Goldstein, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which examines urban environmental issues, said, "To the extent that there is a knowledge gap, this is a plus."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Goldstein cautioned that if the program becomes just another way to collect data without focusing on achieving improvements, it would do little good. "You have to keep your eye on the ball of solving the problem," he said.</p>
        <p>The new program is modeled after the so-called Alert II project of Sao Paulo, whose 12 million people -- 4 million more than in New York -- make it Brazil's largest city. Sao Paulo has had 15 such monitors at access roads and in the city center for the last six years and is already using them to reduce congestion and to improve air quality.  Where 'Bad' Is Normal</p>
        <p>The monitors in the Sao Paulo effort show five standards of air quality -- Regular, Bad, Very Bad, Alert I and, the most dangerous, Alert II.</p>
        <p>Normal readings are Bad and Very Bad. Alipio Casali, chief of the cabinet of the Mayor's Office in Sao Paulo, said the readings have generated public support for a number of traffic-control measures, like adjusting office hours to reduce downtown traffic and, at one point, banning almost all cars from the downtown area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casali noted that radio announcers are reporting pollution readings daily, which "has made people conscious of the very serious problem. The effort is working satisfactorily."</p>
        <p>New York's monitors will provide technical readings of volumes of pollutants in the air and translate those into terms that would be easily understood at a glance. As in Sao Paulo, the range could go from Regular to Alert II. One idea is to superimpose an image of a pair of lungs on the monitor and show the lungs either full or relatively free of pollutants.</p>
        <p>Sao Paulo is cooperating with New York in instituting the project. Two New York City officials, Albert F. Appleton, Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and Gerard Soffian, Assistant Commissioner in the Department of Transportation, signed a technical cooperation and exchange agreement with Sao Paulo officials on Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>The project has been assisted by Mega-Cities, an organization based at New York University's Urban Research Center and devoted to encouraging innovation and exchanges of knowledge to improve living conditions in 14 of the world's largest cities. Polls Show Support</p>
        <p>Dr. Janice E. Perlman, Mega-Cities' president, said that one result of the Sao Paulo effort is that polls there are showing that 65 percent of the population now favors drastic measures like leaving cars home once a week and changing parking regulations to improve air quality.</p>
        <p>The Sao Paulo program is an example of an unusual situation in which developed countries in the Northern Hemisphere are learning from the mostly developing countries in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perlman quoted an Australian aboriginal woman who said: "If you've come to help me, you can go home again. But if you see my struggle as part of your own, perhaps we can work together."</p>
