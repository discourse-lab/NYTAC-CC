        <p>On Inauguration Eve, two environmental groups will sponsor a ball to raise public awareness of air pollution and its effects, specifically how the atmosphere traps pollutants under the sun's heat, like a greenhouse, in a way that is some think will raise the Earth's temperature. The ball will be held in a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>The two groups concerned with reducing pollution, Renew America and the Clean Fuels Development Coalition, are sponsoring a ''Clean Air Inaugural Ball'' on Jan. 20 in the United States Botanic Garden Conservancy, an elegant greenhouse at the foot of Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>The event is co-sponsored by environmental groups, clean energy organizations, members of Congress, William K. Reilly, who was recently named by President-elect George Bush to head the Environmental Protection Agency, and Manuel Lujan Jr., designated as Secretary of the Interior. Among the members of the ball committee are the American Gas Association, the Oxygenated Fuels Association and the American Corn Growers Association, which wants to make clean-burning ethanol fuel from corn.</p>
        <p>''What better place to hold an environmental event than the most beautiful national greenhouse?'' said Tina C. Hobson, executive director of Renew America.</p>
        <p>Admission to the ball is on a first come, first served basis. Tickets are $100 per person, with the proceeds going to support educational programs for clean air. Dress is black tie and green thoughts.</p>
