        <p>Though the scientific consensus says that humans are warming the earth by adding heat-trapping gases to the air, there is continuing uncertainty about the possible cooling influence of clouds.</p>
        <p>Now a new analysis suggests that human activity is also altering the way some clouds form, perhaps intensifying their sun-blocking, planet-cooling effect.</p>
        <p>Some chemicals released by smokestacks, charcoal grills and car exhausts could indirectly increase the sun-reflecting power of clouds by changing the size and number of water droplets, according to researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington.</p>
        <p>Their work, described in the current issue of Science, is an important reminder that much is not known about the behavior of clouds in the human-altered atmosphere, said Dr. O. Brian Toon, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado who is not involved in the study. ''Almost no work is actually being done to model in detail how clouds respond to the polluted climate,'' Dr. Toon said.</p>
        <p>Scientists have long known that clouds reflect the most sunlight back into space, exerting the strongest cooling influence, when they are dense and composed of small droplets. The more droplets, the more surface area; the more surface area, the more light is blocked.</p>
        <p>''The traditional view is it's all meteorology,'' said Dr. John H. Seinfeld, a professor of chemical engineering at Caltech and an author of the new study. ''How fast is the air rising, how much water vapor is in it, how many particles are there? These are the things that affect how many droplets form.''</p>
        <p>The new analysis, led by Dr. Seinfeld and Dr. Robert J. Charlson of the University of Washington, says that chemistry counts as well. Until now, scientists have generally presumed that the number and size of droplets in a cloud is determined almost entirely by the number of particles in the air that serve as ''seeds'' on which water vapor can condense. Indeed, if the air were entirely bereft of motes of sea salt, dust and pollution, there would be no clouds at all, Dr. Seinfeld said.</p>
        <p>Using a computer model accounting not only for physical laws but also for chemical processes, the researchers found that certain acids and organic compounds can limit the growth of individual cloud droplets.</p>
        <p>If each droplet is constrained from growing, this means that the same amount of condensing water ends up spread out among a higher number of smaller droplets. The result is a more reflective cloud, the study said.</p>
        <p>One of the chemicals that exerts the strongest influence is nitric acid, a common byproduct of emissions from vehicles. Others include a variety of organic molecules produced when fuels and wood are burned.</p>
        <p>''It's not just physics any more,'' Dr. Seinfeld said. ''You can no longer ignore what the particles are made of.''</p>
        <p>For the moment, the work has been restricted to computer models, so the team did not try to calculate just how large the cooling effect of these other kinds of pollution might be relative to the warming effect of heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>But many climate experts say the evidence is mounting that the cooling counterweight is significant.</p>
        <p>''The more scientists look at the indirect effects of human emissions on clouds, the more convinced they are that the effects are large,'' said Dr. James E. Hansen, the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Hansen, Dr. Seinfeld and other scientists say it is equally clear that the earth's surface is undergoing a sharp warming. How can the apparent paradox be reconciled?</p>
        <p>Dr. Hansen said it might well be that, just as scientists appear to have underestimated the cooling effect of clouds, they might have underestimated the warming influence of substances that trap heat.</p>
