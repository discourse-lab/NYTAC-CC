        <p>LEAD: Under growing pressure from environmentalists, the European Community on Friday adopted the pollution standards used in the United States for small cars sold in its 12 member countries.</p>
        <p>Under growing pressure from environmentalists, the European Community on Friday adopted the pollution standards used in the United States for small cars sold in its 12 member countries.</p>
        <p>The standards, approved by the community's environment ministers, will become compulsory on July 1, 1992, for new models and on Dec. 12, 1992, for existing models. The community adopted pollution limits for medium-sized and large cars four years ago.</p>
        <p>The controls are expected to add about 7 percent to the price of the small cars, defined as those with engines displacing less than 1.4 liters. These account for two-thirds of the cars in the community.</p>
        <p>The cars will be fitted with catalytic converters and electronic fuel-injection systems. The pollution standards were set at 19 grams a test for carbon monoxide and 5 grams a test for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide.</p>
        <p>Member countries that wish to offer tax rebates to buyers of the lower-polluting models will be allowed to do so, the ministers decided, provided the tax cut is 15 to 20 percent less than the added cost of the anti-pollution devices.</p>
