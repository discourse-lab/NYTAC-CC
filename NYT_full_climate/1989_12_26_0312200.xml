        <p>LEAD: An explosion and fire that damaged parts of a huge Exxon Corporation oil refinery in Louisiana on Sunday could raise heating bills for consumers, at least temporarily, oil industry executives and analysts said yesterday.</p>
        <p>An explosion and fire that damaged parts of a huge Exxon Corporation oil refinery in Louisiana on Sunday could raise heating bills for consumers, at least temporarily, oil industry executives and analysts said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Even before the fire ignited several storage tanks, these experts said, bitterly cold weather in much of the country had begun to strain heating oil supplies and prices rose to unusually high levels.</p>
        <p>The explosion, at 1:30 P.M. Sunday, killed one man at the Baton Rouge refinery, the second largest in the United States. It ignited tanks containing 3.6 million gallons of heating oil and about 882,000 gallons of lubricating oil. The fire was extinguished more than 15 hours later, at about 5 A.M. yesterday.</p>
        <p>The manager of the plant, Ed Galante, told The Associated Press that a release of gas might have led to the explosion but that the cause remained under investigation.</p>
        <p>Exxon officials were still trying yesterday afternoon to determine the extent of the damage. ''The processing units at Baton Rouge appear to be undamaged,'' an Exxon spokesman in Houston said. ''The accident is in the storage area.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, industry experts said that because the nation's heating oil supplies were already under severe pressure because of the month-long cold spell that has chilled much of the United States, the slightest disruption was almost certain to raise prices.</p>
        <p>William L. Randol, a senior analyst with the First Boston Corporation, predicted that the price of heating oil futures would ''skyrocket.''</p>
        <p>John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said: ''Because of the long and extreme cold spell, a tight heating oil market existed at the time of the explosion. If the refinery is out for any length of time, it would obviously continue the tight market.''</p>
        <p>''We haven't had a cold spell this early or this deep for 30 or 40 years,'' he added.</p>
        <p>But energy experts note that a change in the weather, particularly a warming that has been forecast for the Northeastern United States, would reduce demand and act to hold down prices. If the Baton Rouge refinery is out of commission for a week or less, the impact on heating oil prices should be only temporary, they say.</p>
        <p>The Baton Rouge refinery has a capacity to process 450,000 barrels - or 20 million gallons - of crude oil each day. The plant, the largest after an Exxon refinery in Baytown, Tex., accounts for slightly more than 3 percent of the United States' total oil refining capacity. 'Full Conversion' Refinery</p>
        <p>The Baton Rouge facility, which has historically been a training arena for Exxon's top management, is known as a full conversion refinery, capable of producing not only the heating oil and lubricating oil that were destroyed on Sunday, but gasoline, which can account for half of the refinery's output at certain times of year. It also produces jet and diesel fuels.</p>
        <p>Two heating oil storage tanks were damaged in Sunday's fire. One remained intact, despite a charring of its shell, but the other suffered extensive damage, its roof blowing off and its walls folding in, collapsing the tank to half its height and rendering it useless, said Dave Gardner, an Exxon spokesman at the refinery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gardner identified the man killed in the blast as Harold Guillory, a 31-year-old employee of Vernon McKenny Enterprise, an Exxon contractor. Three Exxon employees and four contract employees who were injured in the explosion and its aftermath were treated at local hospitals and released on Sunday. Dependent on Pipe Damage</p>
        <p>Mr. Gardner said the refinery was closed, although some units were not completely shut down, to ease their start-up after a damage assessment was completed. The ability to resume refining, he added, rested on the harm suffered by a collection of pipe systems that carry oil throughout the plant.</p>
        <p>He said the company did not know how much oil from the damaged tanks could be salvaged. Saving some of that oil could have an effect on the prices and availability of domestic heating oil; the 3.6 million gallons in the tanks represents about 3 percent of the 115 million gallons of America's heating oil reserves, Mr. Randol said.</p>
        <p>Wholesale prices for No. 2 heating oil, the kind used in homes and commercial businesses, closed at 81.74 cents a gallon on Friday, a rise of 11.3 cents for the week and of about 30 percent during the last month. Mr. Randol said he had heard of retail prices in some areas as high as $1.30 a gallon.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Randol termed the ''extremely high'' prices for heating oil reflected in part the low supplies that existed at the start of the nationwide cold spell. But other factors also combined to place great strains on domestic heating oil supplies. Not Enough Barges</p>
        <p>One industry analyst noted that the intense demand for heating oil in December meant there were not enough barges to bring oil from refineries to local terminals, limiting supplies and raising prices in some areas of the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states, which account for 75 percent of all the home heating oil used in the United States.</p>
        <p>On top of that, ''this has been a year of accidents,'' said Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. He noted the damage done by Hurricane Hugo in September to an Amerada Hess refinery at St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, that is even larger than the Exxon plant in Baton Rouge and is an important source of heating oil for the United States.</p>
        <p>''Then there was the Exxon Valdez, and there were several accidents in the North Sea over the past few months that damaged supplies,'' Mr. Yergin added. ''And there's still nervousness about what might happen to Soviet oil supplies this winter, because of strikes and internal problems. If Soviet supplies to Western Europe become short, the market here would certainly feel it.'' No Shortage Expected</p>
        <p>Mr. Lichtblau said that despite the higher prices, consumers have been able to buy all the oil they needed. ''There have been no physical shortages, and it looks as if the industry will be able to get through this winter without any,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Despite the cold and the mechanical and natural disasters, a rosy outlook is possible in part because of the weather in Europe, which exports refined oil to the United States.</p>
        <p>While much of Europe experienced a cold spell in November, the last month has been quite warm, enabling European refiners to shift their supplies to the United States.</p>
        <p>Exxon also says its other refineries, particularly in Baytown and in Linden, N.J., are capable of filling any gap in heating oil for the United States that might be created by damage to the Baton Rouge plant. Gasoline Inventories High</p>
        <p>The Baton Rouge fire is not expected to have any impact on gasoline prices. Because gasoline inventories are currently high, at 227 million gallons, prices are unlikely to rise, Mr. Randol said.</p>
        <p>Gasoline is produced as a byproduct of the same process that creates heating oil; increases in heating oil refinement to meet increased demand during the last month have increased inventories.</p>
        <p>What is more, demand for gasoline has been weak, down 4 percent during the four weeks from mid-September to mid-October from the same period in 1988, Mr. Randol said. Among the reasons he cited were consumer fears of a weakening economy, artificially high demand last year by middlemen who purchase gasoline from refiners, and slow sales of new cars.</p>
