        <p>THE TravelCenters of America truck stop here in Gloucester County looks as if it has been invaded by a sprawling extraterrestrial. Yellow tubular tentacles hang from a long metal structure, reaching into the windows of tractor-trailers parked below.</p>
        <p>The volume of the scene seems turned down, as the trucks quietly get their power from the truck stop, not from the thrumming idling of their diesel engines.</p>
        <p>Since August 2004, this electrified truck stop has offered cab heating or cooling, four electrical plugs, wireless Internet access, cable television hookups, phone service and delivery of food from the truck stop's restaurant to truckers on layovers. Those services enter through a console attached to the cab window, and cost $1.60 an hour for fleet members, $1.88 an hour for independent truckers.</p>
        <p>Without the service, truckers would spend close to $3 an hour to idle a semi's engine, at a gallon of diesel fuel an hour -- not to mention wear and tear on the engine and the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The new system has eliminated more than 1,400 metric tons of diesel emissions at the truck stop, and saved more than 134,000 gallons of diesel, said John Doty, a spokesman for the IdleAire Technologies Corporation, which operates the hookups.</p>
        <p>The improvements are visible, said Rick Stahlman, the truck stop's general manager, brushing his finger along the step of the IdleAire office. His fingertip was slightly gray, but not as dirty as it would have been, he said, when the soot from the idling engines lay much thicker.</p>
        <p>That dirt is cause for state and national concern, because with it comes particulate pollution -- microscopic particles that damage the lungs and can cause asthma, bronchitis, cancer and heart disease. According to the state Department of Environmental Protection, soot at levels above federal health standards causes 350 to 1,200 deaths, 6,000 emergency-room visits and 68,000 asthma attacks annually in New Jersey, where the air in every county falls below the federal clean air standards at least part of the year.</p>
        <p>''That's more deaths from particulates than from homicides and vehicular accidents in our state,'' said Assemblyman John F. McKeon, a Democrat from Essex County who sponsored a new law that is expected to reduce diesel emissions by 10 percent over the next seven to eight years.</p>
        <p>Diesel, which burns more efficiently but creates more soot than gasoline does, powers most of the state's transit and school buses as well as farming and construction equipment. Diesel engines also release formaldehyde, benzene and other carcinogens into the atmosphere. Bradley M. Campbell, the state commissioner of environmental protection, said that diesel fumes were responsible for about 20 percent of particulate pollution.</p>
        <p>It cost $1.75 million to electrify 98 bays at the Paulsboro truck stop, with $1 million coming from a settlement that the Coastal Eagle Point Oil Company agreed to pay after violating environmental regulations, said Erin Phalon, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection. The rest of the money came from IdleAire. Other IdleAire stops have been financed partly by the federal Energy and Transportation Departments and the California and Pennsylvania governments.</p>
        <p>All the states in the New York metropolitan area are struggling to reduce particulate pollution, with trouble spots including Fairfield and New Haven counties in Connecticut; Long Island, New York City and the lower Hudson Valley in New York; and 13 New Jersey counties surrounding New York City and Philadelphia, said Ray Werner, a regional official with the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Maryland, Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania also have problems with particulate pollution, which is less prevalent in New England.</p>
        <p>IdleAire, based in Knoxville, Tenn., was formed in 2000 and began with four pilot projects, including one at the Hunts Point Cooperative Market in the South Bronx and two on the New York State Thruway. It now operates in 24 locations in 11 states, and has saved at least five million gallons of diesel, eliminating more than 53,000 metric tons of diesel emissions, Mr. Doty said.</p>
        <p>The company hopes to reach most of the places where trucks congregate, including truck stops, ports and distribution centers like Hunts Point. It has also held discussions with Canadians about building hookups near border crossings, where trucks often idle, Mr. Doty said.</p>
        <p>Three of the four largest national truck stop chains and more than 1,300 trucking fleets have signed up to use the system, he said. The company expects to pass the break-even point next year. Mr. Doty said IdleAire had contracts to install the system at more than 600 truck stops.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the truckers will determine whether the new system becomes a fixture across the Interstates.</p>
        <p>At the Paulsboro stop, which sells about a million gallons of diesel a month, Rick Loudermilk, an Alabama trucker, was parked in his cab with his wife and daughter. He said he had used the new system when making longer stops.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't idle my engine if I was going to sit here a while, and it was hot or cold, especially if I was trying to sleep,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At first, sleeping in a still cab was a problem for John Treibley, who drives for National Freight out of Vineland, N.J. He works from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m., and used to sleep during the day in his idling, vibrating truck.</p>
        <p>''I got so used to sleeping with it, I couldn't sleep'' with the engine off, he said. ''The truck was like a rocking chair.'' But using electricity saves money for the company. ''And if it saves the company money, I get money in the long run,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ray Glenn is a private truck operator, so any money saved goes straight into his pocket. Mr. Glenn, who was hauling a 48-foot trailer, had a console in his passenger window.</p>
        <p>''It's a cheap way out," he said of the hookup. ''There's just not enough of them.''</p>
