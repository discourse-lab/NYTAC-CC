        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was saddened to read "War's Hazards for Environment Are Assessed" (Business Day, Jan. 24), which concludes that though massive burning of Kuwaiti oilfields could have serious environmental consequences for the Persian Gulf region, it would not affect the global climate.</p>
        <p>You attribute to me the idea that large volcanic explosions cool the climate because they inject soot into the atmosphere. What Dr. Richard Turco and I are concerned about in the aftermath of the threatened massive Kuwaiti oilfield fires is soot all right, but the nearest natural analogue to the climate effects that we calculate may result is the 1815 explosion of the Tambora volcano in Indonesia, which produced plenty of fine particles, but no soot. The subsequent year without a summer was marked by massive agricultural failures in North America, Western Europe and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
        <p>This distinction is central. You quote an oil-pollution expert, Richard Golob, as saying that Kuwaiti oil fires could produce only a fraction of the debris of the Tambora explosion. This is absolutely correct as far as it goes. The key point, though, is that soot is one of the darkest materials known in nature, and the soot from oil-well fires is much darker per unit of mass than the sulfuric acid droplets and other nearly transparent debris from volcanic explosions.</p>
        <p>The darkness of soot also means that soot aerosols will be heated by sunlight, warming the surrounding air, which expands and rises, carrying the suspended soot with it. If this effect is neglected, the result will be erroneous underestimations for the altitude and lifetime of the soot as well as for the severity of the climatic effects.
