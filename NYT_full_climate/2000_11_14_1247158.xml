        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The United States is by and large opposed to the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (news article, Nov. 13), through raising prices of carbon-laden fuels. With recent United States Congresses ruling out regulations or efficiency standards, and with no one likely to accept shipping billions of dollars to Russia and Ukraine to buy the emissions rights those countries won't need, the world's greatest emitter doesn't have many options, and the rest of the world knows it.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The United States is by and large opposed to the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (news article, Nov. 13), through raising prices of carbon-laden fuels. With recent United States Congresses ruling out regulations or efficiency standards, and with no one likely to accept shipping billions of dollars to Russia and Ukraine to buy the emissions rights those countries won't need, the world's greatest emitter doesn't have many options, and the rest of the world knows it.</p>
        <p>And few believe that by aiding ''clean development,'' America's interests can even account for a few percentage points of its emissions reduction pledge. So the United States must look at its own domestic options carefully.</p>
        <p>Cleanliness begins at home, and it's time America's politicians and population were told that. No one has to give up a sport utility vehicle today, but everyone has to think about which vehicle to buy next time, and next time is around the corner.</p>
