        <p>Editorial observes that this spring's gloomy weather is reminder of how sunny Northeast can be; sees consolation in astronishing blossoms of trees and plants</p>

        <p>The clouds may have broken as you read this. But if the past few weeks are any indication, the overcast will gather again, and rain will fall until the sun, heavily rationed, peeks out just long enough to make it clear how much we are missing. The weather services say that the gray weather has been caused by a dip in the jet stream and an onshore flow of cold air from the Atlantic. People who know Moscow say we've been having a Moscow spring, and people who know Iceland claim that the low clouds make them think of its southern coast. We all have dank antecedents to draw on.</p>
        <p>These days of dark weather are a reminder of just how sunny the Northeast can really be. New York's climate is hardly Mediterranean, but when the light stays as dim as it has for the past few weeks, you begin to realize that New Yorkers are accustomed to far more sun than we have been getting. We have had a few glorious days of late spring, widely separated, which make the current gloom feel all the more oppressive. Now, when the sun actually shines, the whole region squints at once. What makes it worse is the feeling that the delicacy of May and early June, truly sweet weather, has been lost to us for good. At any moment, the asphalt-melting, subway-asphyxiating summer may roll in from wherever it's hiding.</p>

        <p>Instead of cursing the sky and waiting for relief, the better plan is to look at the vegetation. For all the rigors of last winter and the longueurs of this spring, this has turned into an extraordinary season for pure vegetative vigor. Every tree that blossoms has been heavy with bloom, and the bright new growth on the tribe of conifers is astonishing. On the darkest days, when rain is falling heavily, it's some consolation to look out and see a soft green glow upon the grass, as if it were giving off some of the sunshine it had absorbed in years past.</p>
