        <p>Does climate play a role in asthma?</p>
        <p>A large-scale study involving children in 50 countries has found that asthma rates may be affected by climate, and that the skin condition eczema may also be affected.</p>
        <p>The study, in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, was based on a survey of more than 650,000 children. The survey was part of a larger international research project.</p>
        <p>The researchers looked at several factors related to climate, including altitude, latitude, temperature and humidity, and found that they all seemed to affect asthma and eczema rates. But indoor humidity topped the list.</p>
        <p>''Possibly the most consistent and important relation that emerged was the one between indoor relative humidity and asthma symptoms,'' the lead author, Dr. Stephan K. Weiland of the University of Ulm in Germany, said in an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>In Western Europe, for example, for every 10 percent mean annual increase in indoor humidity, the prevalence of asthma symptoms reported went up by 2.7 percent, the study said. One explanation may be that dust mites, which may play a role in asthmatic attacks, prefer a humid environment, as does a mold that can cause allergic reactions.</p>
        <p>Less asthma was reported in countries where outdoor humidity fell below 50 percent for at least one month a year, or where there were higher altitudes or greater variations in temperature.</p>
        <p>Doctors have long known that short-term changes in weather like falling temperatures can worsen asthma symptoms, as can higher pollen counts. But, the study said, that does not mean these same conditions are associated with the overall incidence of the disease.</p>
