        <p>AS an antidote to cold weather, there is nothing like a bowl of hot soup. At this time of year -- between rich holiday meals -- a substantial soup is the perfect main course for lunch or dinner, followed with a light salad.</p>
        <p>Legumes like dried beans, peas and lentils make warming and filling dishes, which are especially good on cold days. One of my favorites is black bean soup, flavored with rum and lemon and garnished with a dollop of sour cream and fresh coriander leaves. Leftover slices of Christmas ham can be chopped and added.</p>
        <p>For his white bean soup, Chef Bradley Ogden of the Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur, Calif., uses smoked ham hocks and rich tomato broth, which marries well with the white beans and spicy sausage.</p>
        <p>Sarah Leah Chase's New England version of a French bouillabaisse uses fresh cod, sweet bay scallops, mussels and clams found in her native Cape Cod. She accompanies the soup with a brightly colored, garlicky aioli made with orange and saffron, spread on French-bread croutons. New England Fish Soup</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>For the fish broth:  1/3 cup fruity olive oil  1 bunch leeks (white and tender green parts), rinsed well, trimmed and minced  1 large onion, minced  5 cloves garlic, minced  1 can (28 ounces) crushed toma-  toes  2 cups fresh orange juice  2 1/2 quarts water  2 bay leaves  1 tablespoon dried thyme  2 teaspoons dried tarragon  1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds  1 teaspoon saffron threads  1 strip (2 inches) fresh orange peel  4 to 5 pounds nonoily fish trim- mings, heads and scraps  For the seafood:  2 pounds cod, cut into 1 1/2-to-2 inch chunks  1 pound bay scallops  3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  3 tablespoons dry white wine  2 cloves garlic, minced  1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, ground in a mortar and pestle or finely chopped  1/2 teaspoon saffron threads  2 dozen clams, such as littleneck or top neck  2 dozen mussels  For finishing the soup:  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seed- ed and cut into five julienne strips about 2 inches long  1 small bulb fennel, cut into fine julienne strips about 2 inches long  3 tablespoons Pernod (anise li-queur)  1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Prepare the fish broth: heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large stockpot, then add the leeks and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, for five minutes. Add the garlic and cook three more minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Stir in the tomatoes, orange juice, water, bay leaves, thyme, tarragon, fennel, saffron, orange peel and fish trimmings. Bring to boil, then reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 45 to 50 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. In the meantime, prepare the seafood. Mix the cod and scallops together and toss with the olive oil, wine, garlic, fennel seeds and saffron. Let marinate at least an hour.</p>
        <p>4. Scrub the clams and mussels well and soak an hour in cold water. Just before cooking, drain well and remove the beards from the mussels.</p>
        <p>5. Strain the fish broth into a large, wide, shallow stockpot, pressing hard to extract all the juices from the ingredients. Season the stock with salt and pepper to taste and return to medium heat. Add the julienne of red pepper and fennel and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>6. About 10 minutes before serving, bring the broth to a boil and add the clams and mussels. When the shells just begin to open, add the cod and scallops with their marinade and simmer just until all the fish is cooked, about five minutes. Stir in the Pernod.</p>
        <p>7. Ladle the soup into large, shallow soup bowls. Sprinkle with parsley.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This recipe is adapted from "Cold Weather Cooking" by Sarah Lee Chase, Workman Publishing, 1990. This dish is good with croutons spread with aioli flavored with orange peel and saffron.</p>
        <p>Black Bean Soup</p>
        <p>Total time: Overnight soaking, 3 hours cooking</p>
        <p>1 pound black beans  water to cover  1 large peeled onion stuck with 2 whole cloves  2 carrots, sliced  3 celery stalks, chopped  Bouquet garni (thyme and pars-ley and bay leaf tied in a cheese-cloth bag)  4 whole allspice  1/4 teaspoon ground mace  2 garlic cloves, chopped  1 fresh chili pepper, seeded and chopped  Coarse salt and freshly ground  pepper to taste  1/2 cup dark rum  6 to 8 tablespoons sour cream to  garnish  6 to 8 lemon slices to garnish  6 to 8 teaspoons coriander leaves to garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Soak the beans overnight in cold water to cover in a large noncorrosive saucepan. When ready to cook, add the vegetables, bouquet garni, allspice, mace, garlic, chili, salt and pepper. Simmer gently for two and a half to three hours, adding additional water so there is always plenty of liquid. Remove the bouquet garni.</p>
        <p>2. Puree the soup in a blender. Bring to boil, correct the seasoning and serve hot.</p>
        <p>3. Pour the soup into heated individual bowls, garnishing each one with a teaspoon of rum, a dollop of sour cream, a lemon slice and a sprinkling of coriander leaves.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings White Bean Soup With Tomato Ham Broth</p>
        <p>Total time: Overnight soaking plus 2 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons olive oil  1 cup andouille or other spicy sau- sage, sliced in half lengthwise, then cut into 1/2-inch-thick pieces  2 smoked ham hocks  1/2 yellow Spanish onion  2 each medium carrots and celery stalks  1 small leek, white part only  1/2 cup small white beans soaked overnight in cold water  1 bay leaf, four thyme sprigs and 10 parsley stems, tied with a string  2 teaspoons minced garlic  4 cups water  4 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade  1 28-ounce can tomatoes  1/4 cup chopped parsley  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper.</p>
        <p>1. To an eight-quart stockpot add olive oil and heat. Add sausage, sear over high heat for a few seconds until lightly brown and remove. Reserve for later use.</p>
        <p>2. Drain off some of the fat in the pot, lower the heat and add the ham hocks, onion, carrots, celery, leek, beans, bouquet garni and garlic. Sautee for a minute, then cover and cook for three minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Add water, chicken stock and the canned tomatoes. Simmer for two hours or until the meat is tender and the beans are thoroughly cooked through.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the ham hocks, the vegetables and the bouquet garni. Shred the meat from the ham hocks. To the beans, add the shredded meat, the sausage and the parsley. Heat the soup through thoroughly and season it to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings</p>
        <p>Note: This recipe is adapted from "Bradley Ogden's Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner," Random House 1991.</p>
