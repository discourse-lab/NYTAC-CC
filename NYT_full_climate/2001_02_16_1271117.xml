        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was pleased to read ''Report to Back Forests to Fight Warming'' (news article, Feb. 10). But while it helps to plant new trees, our work with some of the country's leading scientists has shown that much more can be done through prevention of forest loss and protection of older trees.</p>
        <p>Allowing the 747 million acres of forestland in the United States to grow older could significantly increase carbon storage because older forests accumulate and store more carbon than younger forests. Planting more trees is, of course, beneficial, especially when formerly forested areas are restored. But let's not overlook the greater benefits from conservation and stewardship.</p>
