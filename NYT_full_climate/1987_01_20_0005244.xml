        <p>LEAD: Of all those elected to major state offices in Alabama last fall, only the new Governor, Guy Hunt, is a Republican. But as he and the rest of the new administration were sworn in today, ending the long era of the populist coalition brought together under Gov. George C. Wallace, the theme of the day was so pro-business they all sounded</p>
        <p>Of all those elected to major state offices in Alabama last fall, only the new Governor, Guy Hunt, is a Republican. But as he and the rest of the new administration were sworn in today, ending the long era of the populist coalition brought together under Gov. George C. Wallace, the theme of the day was so pro-business they all sounded Republican.</p>
        <p>The new Governor spoke of creating a business climate ''second to none.'' The new Lieutenant Governor, Jim Folsom Jr., who is the son of a former governor who was a populist Democrat, talked of ''new jobs and industry.'' The new Attorney General, Don Siegelman, talked about ''business and industry.'' And the preacher who gave the benediction prayed for ''peace and prosperity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace's own son, George Corley Wallace Jr., was sworn in by his father as the new state Treasurer, but clearly, as Mr. Wallace left the stage in his wheelchair, his support groups, such as blacks and teachers, plaintiff lawyers and labor union members, had lost power, and a new coalition held sway.</p>
        <p>''Whether they are Democrats or Republicans, the conservative coalition has taken back over,'' said Thomas T. Gallion 3d, the County Attorney, who is a Republican.</p>
        <p>''It's a pro-business coalition,'' Mr. Gallion said. ''This state is going to be the most aggressive business-seeking state in the country.'' Push to Improve Economy</p>
        <p>Indeed, after being sworn in with the same Bible used to inaugurate Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederacy on these same Capitol steps, Governor Hunt turned his attention away from the past and devoted most of his speech to the task of warming up the state's business climate.</p>
        <p>Alabama has long lurked at the bottom of the nation in terms of the state's per capita income and of its contribution to such social services as public education. The state needs better jobs, Mr. Hunt said, and he promised that the task of creating them would be ''the foundation of our administration.''</p>
        <p>''I personally will spare no effort to go any place, at any time, to meet with anybody, to carry the message throughout our nation, and abroad, that Alabama is ready, willing and able to do what is necessary to achieve a new plateau of economic prosperity,'' Governor Hunt said.</p>
        <p>''We will leave no stone unturned to make it clear that the business climate is second to none,'' he said. Toward that end, Mr. Hunt pledged a range of initiatives, from an attack on waste in government to a revision of the laws governing lawsuits for personal injury and property damage to improving the state's public education system. Pledge to Upgrade Education</p>
        <p>''We will take all steps necessary to improve the quality, not only of our elementary and secondary education, but of our institutions of higher learning as well,'' Mr. Hunt said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Hunt is the state's first Republican Governor since Reconstruction, and although Alabama politically has not functioned for generations as a two-party system, it was clear that the same change of emphasis has swept the Legislature, and that Mr. Hunt's perspective had support there.</p>
        <p>''We want to see the state move forward and to see the old crowd swept out of office and see a new agenda,'' said Jimmy Clark, the new Speaker of the House. ''That's about all we have in common.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark is a Democrat, but a conservative one, and he has nothing but criticism for the controlling elements of the old Wallace coalition, which he listed as teachers, unions, blacks and trial lawyers.</p>
        <p>''We need to get rid of a lot of waste and duplication,'' Mr. Clark said. ''We have too much bureaucracy, too much contracts for cronies, too many buildings built for friends. There's been just a lot of milking of the political system by a lot of folks.''</p>
        <p>His installation as Speaker, Mr. Clark said, was the result of a movement to make the Legislature more independent of the Governor's office. But he said he would work with Governor Hunt's administration to cut waste.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Clark said he would wait until April for the results of a study of the budget commissioned by Mr. Hunt and conducted by private auditors before deciding how to meet a deficit of about $100 million each in the education and general operating funds.</p>
        <p>The study, he said, would look hard at such state services as human resources, Medicaid and mental health, but he cautioned that ''there's no movement here to do away with food stamps or mental health services.''</p>
        <p>And sharing so much perspective with the new Republican administration, Mr. Clark said, ''doesn't mean we're in bed together.''</p>
        <p>Charles Price, a black Democrat who was appointed by Governor Wallace in 1983 as a state circuit judge, disagreed. ''They're all in bed together,'' he said. ''The Democratic Legislature now is controlled by the Business Council and the Farm Bureau and your very conservative pro-business elements.''</p>
        <p>''There's not going to be any concern about minorities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gallion offered a different view of the political changes. Pointing out that Mr. Hunt has been bringing in professionals from out of state as department heads rather than just appointing people with political constituencies here, he said that the new system was going to be more efficient.</p>
        <p>''I think that getting rid of the old-cronyism type of state government that we have literally had for 50 years - busting that up - is going to put Alabama in the forefront in industrial development in the Sun Belt,'' he said.</p>
