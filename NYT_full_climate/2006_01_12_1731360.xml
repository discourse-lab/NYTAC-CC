        <p>Using ominous martial music and stern voice-overs, the governing Liberal Party has released television commercials suggesting that Stephen Harper, the Conservative leader, supports the Iraq war, conspires with Quebec separatists and may even receive illegal donations from American conservatives.</p>
        <p>With Prime Minister Paul Martin and his Liberals 10 points behind Mr. Harper's Conservatives in some polls less than two weeks before elections, the effort represents a sharp turn in what has been a generally dull contest.</p>

        <p>Using ominous martial music and stern voice-overs, the governing Liberal Party has released television commercials suggesting that Stephen Harper, the Conservative leader, supports the Iraq war, conspires with Quebec separatists and may even receive illegal donations from American conservatives.</p>
        <p>With Prime Minister Paul Martin and his Liberals 10 points behind Mr. Harper's Conservatives in some polls less than two weeks before elections, the effort represents a sharp turn in what has been a generally dull contest.</p>
        <p>The negative commercials were matched by sharp criticism of Mr. Harper by Mr. Martin and the leaders of two opposition parties in two television debates this week, a demonstration that Mr. Harper is the undisputed front-runner even though, just a few weeks ago, few experts thought he could win.</p>
        <p>In the debates Mr. Martin claimed that Mr. Harper would scrap Canada's commitment to the Kyoto climate protocol, support the war in Iraq, join the Bush administration's missile defense program and gut social programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harper's positions have actually moved to the center during the last year, and he has shied away from his past support of positions considered pro-Bush.</p>
        <p>But the Liberal advertisements are aimed at dredging up Mr. Harper's more conservative past. One has a voice reading a Washington Times article saying: ''Canada may elect the most pro-American leader in the Western world. Harper is pro-Iraq war, anti-Kyoto and socially conservative. Bush's new best friend is the poster boy for his ideal foreign leader.'' It ends, ''Well, at least someone will be happy, eh?''</p>
        <p>The Conservatives call the spots ''American-style attack ads.''</p>
        <p>The harshness of the attacks and their anti-Bush overtones are similar to a drive the Liberals made in 2004 that shrank a smaller Conservative lead in the last weeks of the campaign and enabled Mr. Martin to eke out a shaky plurality. But the commercials aimed at the vote on Jan. 23 are even more negative and, some analysts say, indicative of a desperation not seen since the Liberals took power 13 years ago.</p>
        <p>Many analysts predict the spots will not work because the election has become a referendum on the Liberal record, particularly scandals highlighted by an inquiry last year that documented a money-laundering and campaign finance scheme in the late 1990's. A new investigation into possible leaks of inside financial information by the Department of Finance late last year to benefit select investors has been another hard blow to the Liberal campaign.</p>
        <p>Some political scientists also note that Canadians pride themselves as being civil in their politics, not like rough-and-tumble Americans.</p>
        <p>''The negative ads won't work,'' Jeffrey Simpson, a political columnist for The Globe and Mail, said in an interview. ''All they will do is confirm the public view that the Liberals are old and desperate.''</p>
        <p>The Liberal commercial that has stirred the most controversy appeared Tuesday on the campaign Web site. Accented by a military drumbeat, it accused the Conservative leader of having a plan to put ''soldiers with guns'' on the streets of Canadian cities.</p>
        <p>The Liberal Party denies that the commercials are personal attacks.</p>
        <p>And the Conservatives have released a negative advertisement of their own. Titled ''Can We Believe Him?'' the commercial criticizes Mr. Martin because his shipping company's vessels fly foreign flags to avoid Canadian taxes, and he uses a private health clinic while championing the public health system.</p>
