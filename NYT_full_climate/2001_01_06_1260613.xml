        <p>While the year 2000 began with record warmth across the United States, it ended with a prolonged record cold spell that is only now beginning to moderate, climate experts said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The chill began well before the start of winter. The average temperature for the contiguous 48 states for November and December was 33.8 degrees, making it the coldest for those two months in that portion of the country at least since systematic record-keeping began in 1895.</p>
        <p>The second coldest November and  December was in 1898, when the average was 34.2 degrees. The third coldest, 34.6 degrees, was in 1985. The National Climatic Data Center released the figures yesterday.</p>
        <p>The early cold contributed to a shortage of electricity in California last month and transformed storms that might normally have produced  rain into paralyzing ice and snow storms that glazed the Plains and Midwest and blanketed the Northeast, federal officials said.</p>
        <p>On the day after Christmas, Amarillo, Tex., for example, received a foot of snow. And even Buffalo, where that kind of accumulation is something of a yawn, has been unusally dumped on this snow season.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Buffalo had its 21st consecutive day with some snowfall, and from October through December the city had a record accumulation of 95.9 inches, weather officials said.</p>
        <p>Frigid blasts early in the cold months are not unusual, but back-to-back cold months are rare, said Jay H. Lawrimore, chief of monitoring at the climatic data center in Asheville, N.C.</p>
        <p>And the cold was particularly noticeable, Mr. Lawrimore said, ''because we have been running above normal temperatures for many years.'' The five months from last January to May was the warmest such period on record, he said.</p>
        <p>Despite the burst of cold weather, the country can generally count on a continuation of the recent warming trend, he said, which is possibly  linked to a buildup of heat-trapping  gases in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the year 2000 was among the 12 warmest years, with temperatures averaging 54 degrees, despite the cold months. The average from 1895 forward is 52.8 degrees.</p>
        <p>The cold was pumped down from the Arctic because the jet stream, the globe-circling high-speed wind current, was at a higher and colder latitude than usual and contained a sharp kink that took it farther south than usual across North America, said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.</p>
        <p>The kink existed because jet stream had to snake its way around a high-pressure mass of air stuck near Greenland, Mr. Gadomski said.</p>
        <p>Normally, such conditions last at most two or three weeks, he said.</p>
        <p>''But this pattern started in mid-November and only now is showing signs of breaking down,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Such cold blasts are usually dry, Mr. Gadomski said, but in this case were accompanied by ample moisture, producing heavy snow.</p>
        <p>''This is a fairly remarkable period in history since we've been keeping careful records,'' Mr. Gadomski said. ''Folks in the upper Midwest who lived through this December will have stories to tell their grandchildren.''</p>
        <p>He said the cold spell was probably related to shifts in ocean surface temperatures.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, retired Brig. Gen. Jack Kelly, the director of the National Weather Service, said the forecast for the rest of the winter called for more of the same.</p>
        <p>''The eastern and western United States will experience additional cold outbreaks at least through March,'' General Kelly said.</p>
