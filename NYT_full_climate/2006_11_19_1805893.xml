        <p>It is perplexing that people move to leafy suburbs and then wage a mechanized war on leaves. They use leaf blowers for cleanliness and order, but that rationale is misguided, since leaf blowers also foul the air with sooty exhaust and the deafening roar of gasoline engines. That is a heavy price to pay for magazine-pretty lawns and driveways.</p>
        <p>There is only so much that can be done about these vexing machines. Landscaping contractors need to work fast to be competitive, and home owners and businesses, addicted to neurotic extremes of tidiness, have shown no willingness to return to the clean, proven technology known as the rake.</p>
        <p>But now Westchester County has an excellent opportunity to help clear the air. The Board of Legislators should pass a bill offered by County Executive Andrew Spano to require county officials and contractors to replace dirty, inefficient leaf blowers with cleaner-running models by 2009.</p>
        <p>The effort is similar to one pursued earlier this year in southern California, where contractors were encouraged to turn in old blowers and offered new, lower-emission models at a discounted price. The program has sold 1,500 such blowers, whose four-stroke gasoline engines are only one-fifth as dirty as the older, two-stroke models, each of which can emit as much pollution in a year as 80 cars. Mr. Spano estimates that his plan could slash emissions in Westchester by more than 10 tons a year.</p>
        <p>The new law would be imposed in phases to ease the financial blow on landscapers, who are likely to complain about it anyway. Violators could face $1,000 fines and the loss or denial of a license.</p>
        <p>By enforcing stricter air-quality standards, the county would be making a reasonable effort to address an underappreciated public-health menace. And whether the law passes or not, Mr. Spano's office says the county will practice what it preaches: the public works and parks departments intend to phase out their own supply of 160 dirty blowers by Jan. 1, 2009.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano says his proposal would strike a blow for cleaner air and fit with the county's goal of doing its part in the effort to lower greenhouse-gas emissions. It would be an exemplary case of a government acting locally to confront a global problem.</p>
        <p>It is also important on a smaller scale. Cleaner leaf blowers in Westchester may not change the world, but they will give a tiny measure of hope to those who suffer from and are sickened by them. If you have ever strolled along a crackling, leafy sidewalk on a crisp fall morning and been ambushed by a deafening roar and the hot, stinky whiff of burning gasoline, that includes you.</p>
