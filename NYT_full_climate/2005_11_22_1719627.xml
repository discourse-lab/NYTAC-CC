      <abstract>
        <p>Federal climate scientists say global average temperature for October hit modern record, and conclude 2005 will tie or surpass 1998 as planet's warmest year since records began in 1880; northeastern United States also had wettest October on record (S)</p>

        <p>The northeastern United States had the wettest October since reliable records began in 1880, federal climate scientists said. The global average temperature for the month also hit a modern record, driven by unusual warmth in places as widespread as Brazil, Canada and Russia. Several teams of climate researchers have concluded that 2005 will at least tie, and probably surpass, 1998 as the planet's warmest year since records began. The previous record was achieved in part because of a strong natural push from a cyclical El Ni単o warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean. There is no El Ni単o warming this year, and most climate scientists say the continuing warming is being driven mainly by accumulating emissions of heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe emissions.</p>
