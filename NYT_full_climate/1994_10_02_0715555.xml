        <p>LIGHT pollution is not beneficial to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the town and must be minimized," says a proposed law in the Town of Southold.</p>
        <p>Even as citizens across Long Island demand more and brighter lighting along streets, in parking lots and down dark alleys, Southold is moving in the other direction.</p>
        <p>"Keeping the sky from being lit at night is something we should try to achieve," said Supervisor Thomas H.  Wickham.</p>
        <p>Residents are lining up for and against plans to douse execessive lights and glare, as well as limit signs and make neon a glimmer of the past in many sections of Southold.</p>
        <p>The debate is over how to safeguard idyllic areas in a rural town with working farms that date back generations, quaint yet bustling marinas and acres of lush vinyeards without stifling the economic health.  "Basically, we want to see our little piece of old New England two hours from New York City preserved," said Councilwoman Ruth D. Oliva.  head of the committee considering the proposals.</p>
        <p>"If Southold Town becomes just another Brookhaven or Commack or Rocky Point we're in deep trouble," Mr. Wickham said.</p>
        <p>In response to critics who say a crisis does not exist, Mr. Wickham said: "One has to only drive on the South Fork on a summer's day to understand the urgency. It's a disaster traffic-wise. We need to address that here and avoid it beforehand."</p>
        <p>Fred Jens owns Jens Flower Shop and Greenhouse amid farms and fields on Sound Avenue. "I thought they wanted to preserve the quality of life here," Mr. Jens said. "I feel this reverses it. If I turn off my sign lights when I close, those tourists who travel best at night will miss my store. The more they see at night the better their ideas for shopping the next day."</p>
        <p>Some shopkeepers are situated in designated business hamlets and would not be as seriously affected, but still voiced criticism.</p>
        <p>"It's just government's becoming bigger and more intrusive," said Kenyon Tuthill, owner of Kenyon's Book Nook in Southold Village. "I'm a lifelong resident of the North Fork. We have to have business in the community to pay the bills and employ people. It seems there's a small cadre of people who would like to roll business back into the Stone Age here."</p>
        <p>Mr. Jens and Mr. Tuthill agreed that there should be a few guidelines to help maintain the pastoral charm.  "But they've gotten kind of heavy handed," said Mr. Tuthill. He added that 95 percent of the businesses would use good taste in signs and lighting if left to their own devices.</p>
        <p>"If you were looking for a place to open a new business you'd probably run from Southold," said Mr. Tuthill.</p>
        <p>The campaign to darken the lights and diminish the signs gathered steam a few years ago, when a previous administration invited eight planners from the United States and the United Kingdom to spend five days in Southold. The group left behind a book of recommendations.</p>
        <p>The town formed the Town Task Force panel to evaluate the book and glean ideas, among them the proposals for lights and signs.</p>
        <p>"But we don't drive horses and buggies here anymore," Mr. Jens said. "And I'm quite sure they don't in England, where that group came from, either."</p>
        <p>The head of the Mattituck Chamber of Commerce, Audrey Watson, said she wanted to be on the town's own panel but was not included. No business people were appointed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wickham has recently gathered information form business owners, a move that Ms. Watson criticized as "pacification."</p>
        <p>"I don't think Southold will ever be an industrial powerhouse," Mr. Wickham said. "I don't think we will ever attract big business in any significant sense. One of the most important assets this town has is its attractive, open quality; it generates tourism."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wickham said he saw the economic future of the town based on the ability to attract tourists, its marine environment, its rural qualities, its arts potential and many "home occupations."</p>
        <p>"They would love computer-based home businesses to come to Southold," Ms. Watson said. "How impractical. We don't even have computer-support services or sales out here."</p>
        <p>Differences aside, Mrs. Oliva said, business people are becoming "more comfortable" with the proposed changes. "We've been working with this for months," she said. "There's been some grumbling, but not the opposition we first had."</p>
