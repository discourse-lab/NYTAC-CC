        <p>LEAD: One measure of how much New York's ethical climate has improved recently is State Senator Joseph L. Galiber's patience.</p>

        <p>LEAD: One measure of how much New York's ethical climate has improved recently is State Senator Joseph L. Galiber's patience.</p>
        <p>One measure of how much New York's ethical climate has improved recently is State Senator Joseph L. Galiber's patience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galiber acknowledged the other day that it might be considered indecorous for him to be restored immediately as ranking minority member of the Senate Ethics Committee. Since January, Mr. Galiber spent most of the legislative session not in Albany but in a Bronx courtroom, where he was acquitted May 25, with former Secretary of Labor Raymond J. Donovan, of fraud and grand larceny charges.</p>
        <p>Our system of justice presumes people innocent until proved guilty. On that basis, Mr. Galiber is off the hook, as are, for now, his fellow Bronx Democrat, Representative Mario Biaggi, and the others indicted yesterday in the Wedtech scandal. Presumably, however, our political system imposes a higher standard on elected officials than the fact that they have not yet been convicted of a crime. Just how high, though?  For all the self-righteous oratory, the solutions are not so simple. They demand a subtle balance: of the need for financial disclosure with the right to personal and family privacy and of curbing campaign contributions without stifling free expression or providing wealthy candidates with an unfair advantage.</p>
        <p>No regulation will eliminate graft. But lawmakers would be misguided if they do nothing just because they cannot do everything, particularly while scandals continue to unfold.  * * *</p>
        <p>Some Brooklyn Democrats are sweating over the approaching perjury trial of Anthony R. Ameruso, the former Transportation Commissioner and product of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, who has not refused to meet with the prosecutor but has insisted he knows of no wrong-doing.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities have been weighing whether there are legal grounds to indict Bess Myerson, the former Cultural Affairs Commissioner, for hiring the daughter of the judge who was presiding over her companion's divorce case.</p>
        <p>In Albany, at least two Democratic state senators are under investigation for implementing their own version of public campaign financing. (Contrary to earlier assertions, a memo to Senate Minority Leader Manfred Ohrenstein from his lawyers cited ambiguities but cautioned against placing full-time campaign workers on the legislative payroll).</p>
        <p>As prosecutors investigate the financing of past campaigns, lawmakers are debating what do to about future ones.</p>
        <p>The Koch administration is supporting a bill sponsored by Senator Roy M. Goodman and Assemblyman Steven Sanders that would dramatically reduce - from $50,000 to $4,500 - the limit on individual contributions in New York City-wide campaigns but still leave some gaping loopholes (a couple could give a total of $18,000 in the primary and general elections, for instance).</p>
        <p>The bill also would repeal legislation that specifically limited contributions to top city officials from people or concerns seeking discretionary benefits from the city. Much stricter curbs on such contributions have been pending before the City Council for months.</p>
        <p>Under one developing scenario, the Legislature might pass the Council's proposed curbs - eliminating the need for a public referendum and, perhaps, easing pressure for more fundamental changes. (Senate Republicans have allowed themselves to be portrayed as obstructionists in the debate over ethics and campaign financing, to the consternation of the city's Republicans, who hope to capitalize on the predominantly Democratic scandal with a fusion mayoral campaign in 1989).  * * *</p>
        <p>The prospects for optional public financing of campaigns seem slim this year, but the concept has a supporter in Mr. Galiber. He also agrees with the Governor that lawmakers should be barred from representing private clients before state agencies. And he insists he did nothing wrong in forming a company that prosecutors implied had been a front to profit from government requirements intended to encourage businesses (including Wedtech) managed by black and Hispanic executives.</p>
        <p>In a 1979 conversation recorded by the F.B.I., Mr. Galiber told his partner William P. Masselli, a reputed mobster, ''They're paying us to use us.''</p>
        <p>''See, it makes sense,'' Mr. Masselli explained. ''It's like me coming to you, and I say: 'Listen, I got something going here, I need a minority man. You wanna come? There's no investment here. We're gonna take over a company that's going bad. . . , that's going bad. You wanna take a shot?' And we took a shot at it, that's all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Galiber said he harbors no grudges. Indeed, he is looking ahead, perhaps even to a campaign for Congress if Representative Robert Garcia is accused in the Wedtech case, too.</p>
        <p>Which is yet another measure of the ethical climate - an unfortunate meteorological metaphor that might lead to the cynical conclusion that, human behavior, like the weather, is completely beyond our capacity to regulate. Those legislators who believe that, and act accordingly, will be reigning under a cloud.</p>
