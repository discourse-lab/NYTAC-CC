        <p>ANYONE who has ventured to the attic to retrieve a shoe box of photographic negatives has probably seen what havoc is wreaked by warm temperatures and high humidity. The negatives become warped, waffled and unprintable, and the images are lost.</p>
        <p>Now imagine the dismay if the lost negatives are of renowned and priceless images, the kind stored and displayed in museums.</p>
        <p>To make sure that does not happen, museum conservators fight a constant battle against changes in climate in an effort to keep photographs, paintings, artifacts and manuscripts at exactly the right temperature and humidity to avoid deterioration.</p>
        <p>There is only one problem: No one knows exactly what the right levels are, and until recently there was no easy way to find the answer.</p>
        <p>A new computerized system developed by the Rochester Institute of Technology is designed to change that. The technology consists of what is called a Preservation Environment Monitor, which looks like a stand-alone thermostat with a digital display, and a piece of software called the Climate Notebook, developed by the Image Permanence Institute at the university.</p>
        <p>''This is an exciting tool in what is usually considered a not-very-exciting area: preservation,'' said Nora Kennedy, a photograph conservator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''It is incredibly vital for the survival of art and historic objects.''</p>
        <p>The Met is one of the 180 museums, libraries and archives that embarked last month on a two-year trial of the hardware and software. (The project was originally intended to serve about 80 institutions, but when more than twice that many asked to participate, a grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services helped to expand the program.) Other supporters of the project include the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
        <p>Until now, museums have relied on instruments called recording hygrothermographs to keep an ink-on-paper records of a room's temperature and humidity. The instruments are supposed to help conservators track trends in a room's climate.</p>
        <p>But ''at the end of the week or month,'' Ms. Kennedy said, ''you'd end up with stacks of paper that you would have to go through and study.''</p>
        <p>A newer device, called a datalogger, has eliminated some of the problem by keeping computerized records. But to read the records, a person has to bring the device to a computer, plug it in and download the data.</p>
        <p>The technology from R.I.T. allows conservators to see data by glancing at the device. The data can also be transferred via a serial cable or memory card to a Windows computer that runs the software. By plugging in information about the object they are trying to save (a painting's canvas, for example), conservators can then pull up data on how cool the room should be to keep it safe for, say, 100 years.</p>
        <p>Preservationists say that that will enable them to justify the value of climate control to the museum officials who tend the budget.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Kennedy put it, ''You can say, O.K., under these conditions my object is going to last about 20 years before the decay is so extreme it will be no longer valuable or beyond repair.''</p>
        <p>James M. Reilly, director of the Image Permanence Institute, called the technology ''a quantum leap in organizing, interpreting and documenting'' the effects of temperature and humidity.</p>
        <p>''The potential is there,'' he said, ''to really help take better care of the collections.''</p>
