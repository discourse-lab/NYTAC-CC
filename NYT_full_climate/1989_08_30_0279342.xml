        <p>LEAD: Atop lampposts on West 65th Street near Avery Fisher and Alice Tully Halls sit a conglomeration of instruments that look like a high school science fair experiment.</p>
        <p>Atop lampposts on West 65th Street near Avery Fisher and Alice Tully Halls sit a conglomeration of instruments that look like a high school science fair experiment.</p>
        <p>But follow the wires from the lampposts and they end in a white State Department of Transportation trailer parked in Richard Tucker Park. There, data on air pollution and weather conditions are being collected for what the engineer directing the study, Robert J. Ronayne, calls ''one of the most elaborate air studies in the city's history.''</p>
        <p>The data is for an environmental impact statement required by the Federal Government before work can begin on the long-delayed replacement for the West Side Highway, which will run from the Battery to 59th Street. Construction of the roadway, to be built with Federal funds, is expected to begin in 1992.</p>
        <p>The main object of the study is to test levels of carbon monoxide at major West Side intersections to project, through computer analysis, pollution levels from vehicles that would use the new highway. By Federal law the new highway must be designed so it will not create traffic problems that would increase the carbon monoxide level beyond 9 parts per million in an eight-hour period.</p>
        <p>By using weather vanes, wind velocity meters, suction tubes and funnels, the department is monitoring the temperature and wind direction and speed to determine how much carbon monoxide remains in the air. The funnels collect air for analysis, the weather vane records wind direction and an anemometer measures wind velocity.</p>
        <p>Not all of the data may be needed for the Federal permit, Mr. Ronayne said, but overkill is a virtue, not a vice, in air pollution studies. ''We want to get all the information anyone would conceivably ask us for,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far monitoring stations have been set up at six intersections. In addition to 65th and Broadway, they are at Battery Park City; West Street and Chambers Street; 34th Street and Eighth Avenue; 34th Street and 12th Avenue, and 57th Street and Eighth Avenue.</p>
