        <p>In an interview with President Clinton last week he related to me a revealing exchange he had with China's President, Jiang Zemin, at their brief summit meeting five months ago. Said Mr. Clinton: "I had a fascinating conversation with Jiang Zemin in New York when he said: 'Are you trying to contain China or not?' I said, 'No, no, I'm trying to engage, I don't want to contain you.' But I said, 'It might surprise you to know what I think the greatest threat to our security you present is.' And I said, 'The greatest threat to our security that  you present is that all of your people will want to get rich in exactly the same way we got rich. And unless we try to triple the automobile mileage and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, if you all get rich in that way we won't be breathing very well.</p>
        <p>" 'There are just so many more of you than there are of us, and if you behave exactly the same way we do, you will do irrevocable damage to the global environment. And it will be partly our fault, because we got there first and we  should be able to figure out how to help you solve this problem.' I said, 'It's  one thing, Mr. President, I hope we will be cooperating on in the years ahead, because I think that other countries will support your development more if they  don't feel threatened by the environment.' I could tell he hadn't thought about  it just like that before."</p>

I could tell he hadn't thought about  it just like that before."</p>
        <p>No doubt this wasn't the sort of discussion Chairman Mao and President Nixon had, but it's going to be part of the U.S.-China dialogue in the future, because if China's 1.2 billion people all trade in their bicycles for cars it will alter our air and weather. Indeed, it's absurd that American and Chinese leaders have not discussed this earlier, given the stakes involved. But then there is a  lot absurd about the U.S.-China relationship these days, and President Clinton's trip this week only highlights that fact. He went to Korea, then Japan, and then is flying around China to Moscow, where he will try to give Boris Yeltsin a boost for his upcoming election.</p>
        <p>Excuse me, but Boris Yeltsin kills more people in Chechnya on a slow morning  than ever died in Tiananmen Square in 1989, yet for some reason a U.S. President can go to Moscow to support Mr. Yeltsin and no one says boo. But if Mr. Clinton  were to stop off in Beijing, he would be pilloried -- so much so that the White  House was afraid to even consider it in an election year. This is crazy. When Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, are asked why the President can deal regularly with Mr. Yeltsin despite Chechnya, and can't deal regularly with the Chinese leaders because of Tiananmen Square, their answer is that "Russia is a democracy." Now that's interesting. That means we hold authoritarian governments to a higher moral standard than democratic ones.</p>
        <p>In the last three years Mr. Christopher has been to Beijing once, Bill Clinton's never been there and Jiang Zemin has never been to Washington. This is no way to deal with one-quarter of the human race. What the U.S. and China need today is precisely the sort of framework that Secretary of State George Shultz fostered in the mid-1980's for dealing with the Soviet Union. Mr. Shultz  and his Soviet counterpart met at least twice a year at "ministerial" meetings,  which included some 60 experts and senior officials from both countries. They were divided into five different working groups -- human rights, arms control, trade, political issues and global problems (such as the environment), and worked through each one. This approach helped produce cooperation on issues of mutual concern, while giving the U.S. a framework to get right in the Soviet Union's face on human rights -- but without it becoming the single issue on which the whole relationship depended. The result was progress on human rights and strategic issues -- all at a time when the U.S. was calling Russia the "evil empire."</p>
        <p>As Secretary Shultz remarked to me: "I liken this sort of diplomacy to gardening. If you just put in some plants in the spring, and then walk away, when you come back a few months later your garden will be so overgrown with weeds you won't be able to get them out without also pulling out the flowers. But if you tend your garden regularly, and get the weeds out when they are small, your plants will have a chance to thrive."</p>
