        <p>Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company has agreed to spend $9.3 million to reduce mercury emissions from its Phillipsburg plant, Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Protection, announced yesterday. The agreement will settle air and water pollution violations at the company since 2003, and improvements to the foundry are scheduled to be in place by January. The company will also pay a $51,520 fine and contribute $85,000 to a mercury monitoring project in Warren County. The new emissions reduction system is expected to reduce carbon monoxide pollution from the plant by 60 percent and reduce electricity consumption by about 25 percent.</p>
