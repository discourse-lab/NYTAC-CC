        <p>In a clash that left two people dead and a dozen injured, workers at a once-secret Chinese nuclear plant last month shut down a neighboring chemical factory that was poisoning their water supply.</p>
        <p>The incident on Aug. 14 in Gansu Province in northwestern China was initially kept secret. The first report of the episode emerged last weekend in an official regional newspaper, which quoted sources as saying Politburo members had been "frightened and moved" by its intensity.</p>
        <p>The incident is notable because it reflects the seeming powerlessness of China's environmental authorities to respond to public health hazards created by industrial concerns with substantial local backing.</p>
        <p>In this case, a chemical factory subsidized by the Lanzhou Chemical Company on land provided by a small village on the outskirts of Lanzhou, Gansu's capital, went into business last year producing sulfuric acid and carbon disulfide without obtaining any of the required environmental permits.</p>
        <p>The sulfurous stench from the plant immediately set off an uproar, with residents complaining of dizziness, fatigue and respiratory ailments. Some parents fitted children with gas masks.</p>
        <p>In addition, the plant fouled the Yellow River, the region's most important water supply, with untreated waste products described as "blues, greens and yellows," the newspaper, Nan Cai Zhou Mo (Southern Skill Weekend), said.</p>
        <p>Among the reported effluents was hydrogen sulfide, a toxic and flammable gas. The newspaper said that because the chemical factory was just upstream of the former nuclear plant, called Factory No. 471, the waste contaminated the plant's water supply and that of the adjoining households of its workers.</p>
        <p>The water was so contaminated, local officials said, that it was unsafe for industrial use even after it passed through the former nuclear plant's purification system.</p>
        <p>Factory No. 471, now engaged in unspecified "civilian" production, appealed June 5 to local authorities to shut down the chemical factory, citing increased disease, the death of "all fish and frogs" in the vicinity and the death of a number of goats who drank from an irrigation ditch near the plant. Skirmishes Begin</p>
        <p>Some 200 factory workers presented their petition to the provincial leaders, but nothing happened. On June 28, as many as 300 workers held a demonstration in which 3 were injured in an unspecified skirmish.</p>
        <p>Finally, in early July, the newspaper reported, the plant was shut down on the order of the local authorities, but it defiantly resumed operations on July 24. The provincial authorities then issued a stronger warning, saying the chemical factory's managers would be held responsible for ignoring the order.</p>
        <p>But this, too, was ignored.</p>
        <p>Several clashes followed and in one a 60-year-old man was beaten to death, suffering 17 compound fractures, local officials reported. A youth also died from multiple wounds, including severed genitals, the newspaper reported. A dozen others were injured before riot policemen arrived to disperse the crowds.</p>
