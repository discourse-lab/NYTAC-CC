        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appeared to make a joke yesterday while answering a reporter's question about what the city was doing to help the homeless in the cold weather, and some advocates for homeless people immediately criticized the remark as insensitive.</p>
        <p>When the Mayor was asked at a news conference what the city was doing to accommodate homeless New Yorkers during the current freezing spell, he responded: "Well, we're working on warmer weather. Seeing if we can create some warmer weather. The Commissioner of Sanitation and the Department of Environmental Protection is trying to heat the entire city."</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Mayor, Karen A. Crowe, who was at the news conference, said the remark was meant as a joke, but did not reflect on Mr. Giuliani's sensitivities regarding the homeless. But another spokeswoman later said that the Mayor had misunderstood the question and did not realize he was being asked about homeless people.</p>
        <p>When a reporter pressed Mr. Giuliani on the topic, he said the city was trying to carry out its usual policy to "encourage people to go to shelters."</p>
        <p>Several of those who work with the homeless said the remark made them uneasy. Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, called the joke "pretty outrageous." 'Easy to Make Fun'</p>
        <p>"While you're warming your hands by the fire at Gracie Mansion, it's easy to make fun of the life-and-death situation out on the streets," said Ms. Brosnahan, who said she had heard of the remark from a co-worker. "The fact that there is not a single shelter bed available in the city is obviously lost on the Mayor."</p>
        <p>But Ms. Crowe defended the Mayor's approach to homelessness, saying. "As Mayor, he is going to move toward more humane and cost-effective and better treatment for the homeless by getting out of the business of warehousing homeless people."</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Cristyne Lategano, the Mayor's press secretary, said Mr. Giuliani had misunderstood the question.</p>
        <p>"He understood her question to be only about the weather," she said. "He didn't hear the first part. That's why he answered it by saying he hoped for warmer weather."</p>
