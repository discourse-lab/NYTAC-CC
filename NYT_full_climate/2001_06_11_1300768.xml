        <p>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi formed Italy's 59th postwar government today, with a cabinet that balances his need to reward political allies with his desire to reassure European partners.</p>
        <p>With only days to go before a NATO summit meeting in Brussels, Mr. Berlusconi, a conservative 64-year-old media tycoon, selected Renato Ruggiero, 71, a respected technocrat and a former leader of the World Trade Organization, to be minister of foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>The government is expected to be sworn in as early as Monday and then receive a pro forma vote of confidence in both houses of Parliament, where Mr. Berlusconi and his allies have solid majorities.</p>
        <p>In July, Italy will be host to a summit meeting of the major industrial nations and Russia in Genoa. Mr. Ruggiero's experience and credibility abroad will be useful to Mr. Berlusconi, whose conflicts of interest and tangled legal history still unnerve some of his European allies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi's finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, a lawyer and economist who helped shape Mr. Berlusconi's economic platform and served in his first, short-lived government in 1994, is also seen abroad as sensible and is well regarded by business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi found room for the leaders of all the parties within his coalition, including Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League. He was made minister of reform and ''devolution,'' in charge of seeing that the government gives more autonomy to the regions, the basis of Mr. Bossi's political movement.</p>
        <p>The Northern League's No. 2 leader, Roberto Maroni, was vetoed during the negotiations over the Justice Ministry because he faces criminal charges for activities related to the Northern League, was given the Welfare Ministry. Another Northern League politician, Roberto Castelli, his party's Senate whip, got the Justice Ministry.</p>
        <p>Most of the important posts went to loyalists of Mr. Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. Antonio Martino, foreign affairs minister in the first Berlusconi government, was appointed defense minister; Claudio Scajola, the party strategist, will be interior minister.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Berlusconi's most reliable allies, Gianfranco Fini, who cleansed his right-wing National Alliance of its Fascist roots, will be deputy prime minister.</p>
        <p>The only surprise was that Mr. Berlusconi appointed two women: Letizia Moratti, an independent who was director the Italian state broadcasting company RAI, will be minister of education. Stefania Prestigiacomo, 35, a Forza Italia member of Parliament from Sicily, will be in charge of equal opportunity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruggiero, a diplomat who has served in Brussels, Washington and Moscow, is also comfortable in corporate boardrooms. He was a roving ambassador for Fiat in 1991. He is a vice chairman of the investment bank Schroeder, Salomon Smith Barney, and is on the advisory board of Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, a consulting group that Mr. Berlusconi has tapped to help devise ways to modernize Italy's public sector.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi is unlikely to delegate foreign policy. Last week, he put himself on the record as being more congenial to President Bush's conservative views on pollution and the environment than his predecessors or other European leaders.</p>
        <p>There is some self-interest for Italy in that view. Italy's greenhouse-gas emissions have risen 4.6 percent since 1990, according to the European Agency for the Environment, meaning it would have to reduce emissions by 10.6 percent by 2012 under the Kyoto environmental accord, which Mr. Bush has abandoned.</p>
