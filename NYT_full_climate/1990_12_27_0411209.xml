        <p>The weeklong blast of Arctic air that has brought below-freezing temperatures to Southern California has severely damaged the state's citrus and avocado crops, agriculture officials said today.</p>
        <p>"There will be major fruit damages," said Jim Smith, an analyst for the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said it was too early to gauge the extent of the crop loss. But growers and local officials, still assessing the damage, put it in the hundreds of millions of dollars, which could soon mean higher fruit and vegetable prices in supermarkets around the country.</p>
        <p>The cold weather in the usually balmy region has caused a rapid rise in orange juice prices on the commodities exchanges in the last week. On the New York Cotton Exchange today, frozen concentrated orange juice for March delivery rose 2.05 cents a pound, closing at $1.1995. On Dec. 17, it closed at $1.0470. Avocados Also Suffer</p>
        <p>In addition to oranges, lemons and other citrus fruits, avocados, one of the state's largest food exports, were also badly hit.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the California Avocado Commission estimated that 20 percent of the state's crop had been lost. Ninety percent of the nation's avocados are grown in California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said up to 20 percent of the navel orange crop in California and Arizona had been harvested before the cold snap. But harvesting of Valencia oranges has not progressed as far, he added.</p>
        <p>In Tulare County, where most of the state's navel oranges are grown, the loss to this year's harvest was put at $200 million. In Ventura County, the damage to lemons and avocados has amounted to at least $100 million, said Jim Fulmer, Deputy State Agricultural Commissioner. More on the Way</p>
        <p>Although Los Angeles County was not hit as badly as some other areas, its losses could reach $3 million, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Arctic air mass has brought record low temperatures, from the teens to the 30's, throughout much of California for the last week. A slow warming trend began Tuesday, but forecasters said it would not last. They warned that anothr blast of Arctic air would arrive by the weekend, with the likelihood of more damage.</p>
        <p>If the new cold snap is severe, officials said, some growers may have to forgo trying to save their fruit and concentrate on saving their trees instead.</p>
        <p>Before the bad weather hit, the United States Agriculture Department put 1990-91 production of California navel oranges at 40,000 boxes and Valencia oranges at 23,000 boxes. Growers say these forecasts will have to be drastically revised.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the California crop is sold for the fresh-fruit market. Some damaged fruit may be salvaged for use in processed goods, the Agriculture Department said.</p>
