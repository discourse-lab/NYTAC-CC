        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mel Gussow's ''nary a nibble in the kitchen of 'Miss Julie' ''  [ ''The Curtain Rises on Kelp Lasagna and Chopped Liver,'' Feb. 26 ]  is language worthy of Oscar Wilde but, unfortunately, inaccurate. Strindberg uses food quite deliberately during the first scene in ''Miss Julie'' to establish relationships and to reveal personalities.</p>
        <p>Kristin, the cook, prepares a meal for Jean, the valet, which he hopes is ''tasty.'' The food is, she says in the Sprigge translation, ''just a little bit of kidney I cut off their joint.'' Jean allows as kidney is his ''special delice,'' but chastises her for not warming the plate. Kristin then offers Jean a beer, which he refuses for ''something better than that'' as he produces a bottle of wine which he has taken from the Count's cellar; he proceeds to instruct her on its label and value.</p>
        <p>Thus, in a short conversation about food and drink, Strindberg has revealed a sensual, class-conscious valet and a pilfering cook. Later, Jean uses the bottle of wine to humiliate the fallen Miss Julie, who prefers beer, as she recognizes herself as an accomplice to a petty thief. Strindberg's Naturalism would dictate food on the play's kitchen table.  J. C. KOHL  Poughkeepsie, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mel Gussow replies: Rechecking the Strindbergian menu, one is surprised to discover not only nibbles in the kitchen of ''Miss Julie'' but also hot chocolate in ''The Stronger'' and a steady flow of food and wine in other cafes and creameries visited in the works of the august playwright. The captain in ''Dance of Death,'' a confirmed epicurean, drinks grog and smacks his lips over remembered veal. In the case of Strindberg, there is a healthy appetite in a wintry climate.</p>
