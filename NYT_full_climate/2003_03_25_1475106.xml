        <p>Thunderstorms can set off asthma attacks, and fungus may be to blame, a Canadian study has found.</p>
        <p>In several countries over the years, emergency room visits related to asthma have spiked after severe thunderstorms, the study's lead author, Dr. Robert E. Dales of the University of Ottawa Health Research Institute said.</p>
        <p>But the link has neither been well established nor explained, he added.</p>
        <p>For the study, which was published in the journal Chest, the researchers examined four years of records from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and compared the pattern of asthma attacks with daily data on weather, airborne allergens and pollution collected at a nearby airport.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dales said that hospital visits for asthma were 15 percent more frequent on days with thunderstorms than on other days. The cause, he said, appeared to be fungal spores, which were found to be more common in air samples on those days, while other allergens, like pollen, were not.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dales said he suspected that a storm's winds and downpours worked together to raise the level of fungal spores in the air: rain dislodges the spores and suspends them in droplets that are then spread by strong gusts and updrafts.</p>
        <p>People who have more severe asthma problems after thunderstorms should ''should stay indoors and use asthma medication if needed,'' Dr. Dales said. But they should also be tested to see if they are allergic to fungi, he said.</p>
