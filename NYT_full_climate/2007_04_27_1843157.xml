        <p>VINEYARDS, orchards and an almost inexhaustible supply of sun are luring second-home buyers to Naramata, a British Columbia village some 50 miles north of the United States border.</p>
        <p>It is part of a region called the Naramata Bench, which stretches north along the east bank of Okanagan Lake from the city of Penticton to the Okanagan Mountain Provincial Park.

        <p>VINEYARDS, orchards and an almost inexhaustible supply of sun are luring second-home buyers to Naramata, a British Columbia village some 50 miles north of the United States border.</p>
        <p>It is part of a region called the Naramata Bench, which stretches north along the east bank of Okanagan Lake from the city of Penticton to the Okanagan Mountain Provincial Park. Sandy beaches dot the twisty 12-mile shore, some at the foot of imposing bluffs. It's obscure yet accessible for those seeking second homes.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of intention in the community to preserve the character and charm of what's here,'' said Jane Shaak, a real estate agent with Royal LePage, who grew up in Naramata.</p>
        <p>In the village, the California Mission-style Heritage Inn rises at the foot of Robinson Avenue. John Moore Robinson, the namesake of the calm thoroughfare, built the hotel 99 years ago. Restored in 2001, the inn has become a catalyst for Naramata, which was known as East Summerland until the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson discovered the name during a s√©ance led by the wife of the local postmaster. It is said that she conjured the spirit of an Indian chief who spoke lovingly of his wife, Nar-a-mat-ah. Mr. Robinson liked the way it rolled off his tongue.</p>
        <p>Wharf Park was where concertgoers destined for the local opera house disembarked from a paddle-wheeler, while fruit crates were loaded onto cars on the Kettle Valley Railway. The Sun Fresh Cooperative's fruit-packing plant remains, but the opera house and railroad tracks are gone.</p>
        <p>The arid climate and abundant sun are ideal for ripening grapes at the 16 wineries along meandering Naramata Road. These include Lake Breeze Vineyards, the producer of an award-winning pinot gris. The Okanagan Spring Wine Festival is May 3 to 6 (www.owfs.com).</p>
        <p>William Cambridge, a former Napa Valley wine concierge-cum-restaurantconsultant, sampled Seattle, Hawaii and Santa Barbara before settling on Naramata for a second home. He bought a 900-square-foot bungalow and 400-square-foot studio near Robinson Avenue with his wife, Cherie, in 2000 for 100,000 Canadian dollars..</p>
        <p>Real estate agents say that while Naramata is attracting more attention as a second-home community, it is remaining true to its practical agricultural underpinnings, even if grapes for wine overshadow peaches, apples, apricots and cherries.</p>
        <p>''People who are building here generally bring an architectural sensibility that befits the area; that is, no flights of fancy with French chateaus or Tuscan villas,'' Mr. Cambridge said. ''Rather, new houses tend to have a sturdy feel, often using timber-frame construction and using Arts and Crafts detailing.''</p>
        <p>The Scene</p>
        <p>Naramata's summer temperatures hover in the mid-80s and dip just below 32 in winter, pleasing makers of ice wines. Skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing are available less than an hour west at the Apex Mountain resort from November to April.</p>
        <p>In warmer weather, children of all ages line up at the Naramata general store for a scoop of ice cream, and across the street, the Village Grounds Cafe doubles as community living room and sundeck.</p>
        <p>The village's spiritual and physical heart is the Naramata Centre, a 23-acre retreat and conference center of the United Church of Canada that was built in 1947. There are no gates, and the public is welcome to use the semiprivate beach.</p>
        <p>Janis Magnuson, a lawyer and publisher from Calgary, Alberta, discovered Naramata as an 11-year-old baby sitter employed by a minister at the Naramata Centre. She left the lakeside retreat with bandaged ears that summer after a bit too much fun in the sun.</p>
        <p>''My Naramata memories always come with a little pain attached,'' Ms. Magnuson said, laughing as she looked across the lake from her patio. She and husband, Ray Sobol, found a peaceful second home in the area as a refuge from Calgary.</p>
        <p>They were looking at properties in Penticton and Summerland during a winery tour in fall 2005 when they had an epiphany. ''We were on the wrong side of the lake,'' she said. They spent almost 400,000 Canadian dollars (about $348,000 at the current exchange rate of 1.15 Canadian dollars to the United States dollar) for their 1,870-square-foot house with a view of Giant's Head Mountain in Summerland. They enjoy the small-town charm and simple pleasures, like gazing at stars without the glare of city lights.</p>
        <p>Glenn Albin, who edits Ocean Drive magazine in Miami Beach, visits Naramata five times a year with his partner, Alexander Albrecht. Their 2,000-square-foot modern cedar house was built in the 1960s. It is on 3.5 acres near a mountainside and is valued at 900,000 Canadian dollars.</p>
        <p>''Naramata's a very private, behind-the-hedges sort of place, but once inside, the dinners and parties are full of creative, energetic, soulful people,'' Mr. Albin said. ''Naramata is also very accepting. It's one thing to mix orchardists and grape growers, but here there are rich and poor, straight and gay, country people and urbanites. There are more tractors than Porsches, and that's the way I'd like it to remain.''</p>
        <p>He and Mr. Albrecht plan to plant an acre of syrah vines this year.</p>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <p>The village is unincorporated, so property taxes are low, averaging 1,800 Canadian dollars a year. Penticton, with 33,000 people, is 20 minutes away at the south tip of the lake; Kelowna, population 105,000, is 90 minutes north. An ultraviolet water filtration system is expected to be completed this year.</p>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <p>Naramata has few public moorings, though Penticton has ample marina space. The village has few amenities, which means Penticton is a frequent destination. You could start a hobby winery, but large players dominate the commercial market.</p>
        <p>The Real Estate Market</p>
        <p>A 2,200-square-foot house averages 439,000 Canadian dollars, according to the South Okanagan Real Estate Board, nearly 500 percent above the average for a similar property two decades ago.</p>
        <p>Waterfront property isn't often available. A cozy, one-story waterfront cottage on a small lot was offered last year for about 1.2 million Canadian dollars, and a three-bedroom, 2,960-square-foot house on 4.5 acres with its own beach was listed at 5.1 million Canadian dollars; both were outside the village. A 10-acre organic fruit and vegetable farm near the village with a four-bedroom house was priced at nearly 1.6 million Canadian dollars.</p>
        <p>LAY OF THE LAND</p>
