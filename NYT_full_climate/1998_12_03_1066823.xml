        <p>It's appropriate, somehow, that anyone calling himself a skiing weatherman might also ski. Isn't it easier for skiers and boarders facing wet snow or ice to know that their meteorologist might also be boot-deep in slush or skidding on boilerplate?</p>
        <p>Such is the psychic fallout affecting Herb Stevens, the television weatherman who disseminates a weekly forecast of 1 minute 25 seconds on 30 stations from Florida to Maine. He has an opinion on everything having to do with weather, especially if the subject is as debatable as La Nina.</p>

        <p>It's appropriate, somehow, that anyone calling himself a skiing weatherman might also ski. Isn't it easier for skiers and boarders facing wet snow or ice to know that their meteorologist might also be boot-deep in slush or skidding on boilerplate?</p>
        <p>Such is the psychic fallout affecting Herb Stevens, the television weatherman who disseminates a weekly forecast of 1 minute 25 seconds on 30 stations from Florida to Maine. He has an opinion on everything having to do with weather, especially if the subject is as debatable as La Nina.</p>
        <p>''I give skiers a look into the future of weather, rather than telling them what the weather is on any one day,'' Stevens said from his office in North Kingstown, R.I. ''That's particularly true of ski conditions in the East, where weather changes so rapidly. In Colorado, once the snow surface is established, it stays fairly similar except for occasional dumps of new snow. But in the East, we can undergo three surface changes in 24 hours.''</p>
        <p>Stevens has deduced that La Nina -- El Nino is the warming phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that affects the climate around the globe, and La Nina is its associated cooling phase -- will bring more cold air and snow than usual to the Northeast this winter, despite the region's recent stretch of warm weather.</p>
        <p>''It will be with us throughout the winter and into the spring,'' he predicted. ''Whereas the southern portion of the jet stream was more active and powerful last year, the opposite is apt to prevail this year.''</p>
        <p>Ski areas within the shadow of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain are likely to receive snow from cold air masses sweeping over the lakes from Canada, he added.</p>
        <p>Benefiting from the movement will be areas in northern Vermont especially, such as Smugglers' Notch, Jay Peak, Sugarbush and Mad River Glen. The lake effect is likely to be felt as far south as New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, Stevens said. Indeed, areas such as Smugglers' Notch had a record snowfall during the last La Nina period, which came during the 1995-96 ski season.</p>
        <p>''If you have a meltdown, you can make up for it,'' said Barbara Thomke, a spokeswoman for Smugglers' Notch. Last winter, however, the cold spells did not last long enough for many ski areas to recoup their losses from warm spells. Smugglers', for example, had 219 inches of snowfall last season compared with 334 inches in 1995-96.</p>
        <p>Resorts able to make snow will benefit not only from natural accumulations, but also from the ability to make snow and count on it lasting through occasional thaws. Ski areas more to the east, such as those in Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and southeastern New York, according to Stevens, are outside the lake-effect band. But they are still apt to have a better-than-average winter.</p>
        <p>Areas in the Catskills, such as Hunter Mountain, were open in early November this year during a mid-autumn cold spell. But then they had to close and reopened toward Nov. 20.</p>
        <p>The West will experience a different La Nina effect, Stevens said. The southern Rockies are likely to see a drier and milder winter than they had last season with the huge dumps of snow brought on by El Nino. But in the northern climes, the opposite is predicted. ''I'd say stay north of Interstate 70,'' Stevens said, referring to the highway that cuts through the Rocky Mountains outside Denver.</p>
        <p>Cliff Harris, a climatologist in Jericho, Vt., sees a similar picture. ''La Nina takes what is normal and enhances the pattern,'' he said. ''But during the El Nino periods, which the country is just pulling out of, the opposite was true. Dry areas turned wetter, wet areas turned drier, and normally cold areas turn warmer.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Last year, we had a relatively snowless winter in the Northeast. El Nino was holding all that cold weather at bay. In northern New England, we had flooding and the worst ice storm in history. But here in Vermont, things are fairly normal right now.</p>
        <p>''I don't expect the really harsh, cold stuff, the main body of the serpent, to come in at least until the end of December.''</p>
        <p>MOGULS</p>
        <p>The $500,000 Ford Downhill Series, the lucrative circuit for professional skiers, runs from December through March at resorts throughout the United States. Competing for the United States this season will be TOMMY MOE and A J KITT and for France LUC ALPHAND and ADRIEN DUVILLARD. Events will be in Aspen, Colo.; Vail, Colo.; Beaver Creek, Colo.; Mammoth, Calif.; Sugarbush, Vt., and Squaw Valley, Calif.</p>
