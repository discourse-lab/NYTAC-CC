        <p>LEAD: Do not dare to say that s----- has arrived. In New York City, the current new season has a way of making one superstitious. The first week of April 1982 brought snow. So did the last week of April 1986. It is not, in any case, necessary to mention the vernal equinox or the last two days' temperature.</p>

        <p>Do not dare to say that s----- has arrived. In New York City, the current new season has a way of making one superstitious. The first week of April 1982 brought snow. So did the last week of April 1986. It is not, in any case, necessary to mention the vernal equinox or the last two days' temperature. One need only observe that all over the city, New Yorkers were taking off their clothes.</p>
        <p>Even those who wore coats unbuttoned them and revealed a lot of sins, sartorial and gastronomic. Others dragged jackets and cardigans around, over one shoulder, fingers tugging at the collar. Still others opened their shirts to the midday midtown sun.</p>
        <p>That shawl - the black and white number with the ball fringe - that everybody's been sporting has disappeared. So has the knitted cap that comes down over the eyebrows. Mittens are gone, and so are gloves except among those who wear them for fashion's sake.</p>
        <p>As for babies, most are out of their snowsuits and for the first time in months it is possible to admire infants passing in their strollers without squinting through a plastic greenhouse. The trick in all this is to enjoy the weather without generalizing. To do is to risk getting something wet and white in the eye.</p>
