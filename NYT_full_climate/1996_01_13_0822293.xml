        <p>Heating oil prices fell yesterday for a third day, as forecasts for warmer weather and a report of rising inventories signaled weakening demand.</p>
        <p>"The market is a mess," said Drew Dickson, oil trading director at the GSC Energy Corporation in Atlanta. "The warmer temperatures have run fear into people about future demand."</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service is calling for above-normal temperatures in the Northeast all next week after a weekend snowstorm.</p>
        <p>That warming could dampen heating needs by as much as 18 percent, said a report by Weather Derivatives. In the Midwest, heating demand may run about 30 percent lower than normal, it said.</p>
        <p>Heating oil for February delivery tumbled 2.59 cents, to 53.57 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling 9.8 percent in the last two days. February crude oil slumped 54 cents, to $18.25 a barrel, the lowest since Nov. 30.</p>
        <p>Demand for heating oil has not met expectations even during the coldest months of November and December. Inventories of distillate fuels, including heating oil, rose by 2.4 million barrels last week to 131.6 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute said. Traders had expected a decline.</p>
        <p>On other markets, copper and gold prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau  index dropped 1.31 points, to 241.59.</p>
        <p>Copper prices fell to a 15-month low as rising stockpiles in exchange warehouses showed demand was falling behind mine output. March copper fell 2.65  cents, to $1.127 a pound on the Commodity Exchange in New York, its lowest price since Sept. 30, 1994.</p>
        <p>And gold prices plunged as mining companies took advantage of the highest prices in more than two years to sell some of their production. February gold fell $2.60, to $396.70 an ounce on the Comex.</p>
        <p>Other precious metals also dropped. Comex March silver slipping 6 cents, to $5.47 an ounce, while April platinum dropped $1.30, to $417.90 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
