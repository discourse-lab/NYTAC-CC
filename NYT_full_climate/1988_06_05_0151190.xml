        <p>LEAD: WHEN my friends and business associates heard that I was moving from New Jersey to Murray, Ky., they sent me sympathy cards - lots of grim black borders and soothing words about time healing all wounds.</p>
        <p>WHEN my friends and business associates heard that I was moving from New Jersey to Murray, Ky., they sent me sympathy cards - lots of grim black borders and soothing words about time healing all wounds.</p>
        <p>And then Rand-McNally named Murray the No. 1 retirement spot in the nation.</p>
        <p>''You've got to be kidding!'' a friend shrieked with laughter, after reading about the dubious designation in The Wall Street Journal. ''Aren't you cashing in your chips a little early?''</p>
        <p>''I want to move to Kentucky,'' I protested. ''There are lots of advantages over New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>But the real reason was that I planned to remarry, and my fiance had moved to Murray recently to take a job as director of Murray State University's art galleries.</p>
        <p>When the possibilities of a new home in Kentucky first came up, I admit that I was less than enthusiastic. All I knew about the state was bluegrass, the Derby and ''My Old Kentucky Home.''</p>
        <p>Before my fiance accepted the position, we took a trip together so I would have a better idea of the life style, as well as the business climate. I started warming up to the idea, and he signed his contract.</p>
        <p>After a few house-hunting excursions, I returned to New Jersey armed with descriptions of lovely lakes, a relaxed pace and the friendliness of the people.</p>
        <p>''You'll miss New York,'' a friend warned. ''And what about the ocean?'' I guess I will miss New York, at least the concept. Lincoln Center, Broadway, SoHo, Greenwich Village are among my favorite places - in theory at least. But I certainly will not pine for the grimy menace of city subways, the world-class rudeness of cab drivers or restaurant bills that would make a sheik shudder. The ocean?  Well, it is wonderful. In February, that is, when there are not millions of people thronging the beaches and thousands of cars overheating as they line up to park at Sandy Hook. Friends paid their last respects when I said I was moving. I won't even mention the garbage barges, or the garbage that deterred swimmers at the Shore for most of last summer.</p>
        <p>Such facts did not dissuade my Kentucky-trashers. Instead of a bridal shower, I was feted at a kind of prenuptial wake.</p>
        <p>Friends paid their last respects, offering gifts that might ease the transition: A video of Woody Allen's ''Manhattan,'' wine lists from my favorite restaurants, a set of flatware stolen from the Harvard Club.</p>
        <p>But now that I have lived in Murray for a couple of months, I am still waiting to be ambushed by grief, or at least tweaked with a twinge of nostalgia. Nothing so far, except for an occasional craving for a plump New Jersey tomato. And it's still too early for that.</p>
        <p>So far, I like it here, in spite of the bleak forecasts from my friends. I was in a Piggly Wiggly the other day and the boy who bagged my groceries offered to tote them to my car.</p>
        <p>''What'll it cost?'' I snarled, my metropolitan misanthropy prevailing.</p>
        <p>''Nothing, ma'am,'' he replied with an earnest grin. ''We just want ya'll to come back.''</p>
        <p>I couldn't believe it. And tipping is forbidden.</p>
        <p>I recall an experience in a New Jersey grocery store. The cashier had dropped a 20-pound turkey on top of a dozen eggs, and when I asked her to be more careful, she responded:</p>
        <p>''Look, lady, next time you'll be lucky if you get outta here without a few bruises yourself.'' What a contrast to Murray. Its citizens are blissfully cheerful. They are polite, even friendly. They greet strangers on the street and wave ''Good morning'' from their cars.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, there are several hand gestures that are common to drivers. As far as I know, none of them translates into ''Have a nice day'' or ''Your mother is most likely a pleasant woman.''</p>
        <p>Driving in Murray is a treat, even relaxing. Horns don't blare the instant a traffic light turns amber, Meter Maids don't hum the theme from ''Jaws'' as they wait for the dial to click to overtime and gridlock is as scarce in Murray as a legal ounce of bourbon. (Murray is in Calloway County, a dry county).</p>
        <p>Speaking of legal issues, I have seen nothing in the newspapers about raising funds to buy bullet-proof vests for Murray's finest. There are no ''Crime Watch'' stickers plastered on telephone poles, and I am even getting used to being without a burglar alarm.</p>
        <p>I could go on for hours. Property taxes do not rival the national debt, car insurance does not equal the cost of a 10-day cruise and house closings do not require a fleet of lawyers.</p>
        <p>Murray, Kentucky. A nice town. A good place to live.</p>
        <p>But I don't tell my friends, for then they might visit. How can I ever get away from it all if they also decide to move to Murray?</p>
