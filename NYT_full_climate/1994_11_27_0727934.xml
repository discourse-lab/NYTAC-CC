        <p>From the composting of cafeteria waste in the basement to the roofing made of recycled tires, the High School for Environmental Studies is living up to its name.</p>
        <p>The school, which started at the old Stuyvesant High in 1992, moved this fall to its permanent home in a three-building complex at 444 West 56th Street. Practicing what it teaches, the school set an earth-friendly example in designing the $23 million renovation of the buildings, formerly a 20th Century Fox studio and headquarters.</p>
        <p>The newly installed environmental features were conceived as a model for school construction and as a case study for its students. It was designed and built by the related MBA Municipal, Meli-Borrelli Associates and John Borrelli companies.</p>
        <p>The school, which expects to reach full enrollment of 900 next fall, teaches special topics like environmental law, environmental health, marine biology, botany and horticulture, as well as standard courses.</p>
        <p>Academic and extracurricular activities include testing Hudson River water for pollution, rock climbing, work with the Central Park Conservancy, a community garden in the Bronx and field trips to places like Alaska, Lithuania and Baja, Calif.</p>
        <p>"People hear about the things we have and are quite amazed," said the principal, Alexander Corbluth. B.L. What Makes a Building Sensitive?</p>
        <p>The environmentally sensitive features of the new building of the High School for Environmental Studies include the following.  * Indoor wall panels made of recycled newspapers</p>
        <p>* Ceiling tiles manufactured from processed seaweed * Energy-saving lights * Water-saving plumbing fixtures * Zoned heating and cooling with computerized controls * Insulating double-pane windows * Roofing composed of recycled rubber tires * Skylights for the gymnasium (3d floor of building on 55th Street side of complex) * A greenhouse atrium on the 6th floor (east side of roof) * A rooftop garden in planters made of recycled water-tower redwood with trees and other plants planned for the spring (west side of roof) * Recycling bins ordered for the basement for paper, cans and glass * Composting center planned in the basement * Weather-monitoring instruments on the roof (mid-building) * Room with special climate controls for raising animals (6th floor) * Dishwashers for permanent rather than disposable plates (4th floor)  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN</p>
